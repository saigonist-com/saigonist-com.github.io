    <title>Muong language</title>
    <link>http://www.saigonist.com/b/muong-language</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Thanks to all the responses from people who listened to the short audio I posted the other day of a man &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.saigonist.com/content/if-you-are-vietnamese-speaker-please-play-following-audio-what-man-saying&quot;&gt;&quot;speaking strange Vietnamese&quot;&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;I got all kinds of answers from &quot;it&#039;s Vietnamese&quot; to &quot;it sounds like Thai mixed with Vietnamese&quot; to &quot;it sounds like a Thai or Cambodian man speaking Vietnamese&quot;. &amp;nbsp;Some people actually understood the content quite clearly, which talks about Jesus, while others couldn&#039;t understand it at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the segment was neither a man speaking Vietnamese nor a foreigner speaking Vietnamese with an accent. &amp;nbsp;This man was speaking his native language, which is Mường, a language closely related to Vietnamese, and perhaps closer to the origins of the Vietnamese language. &amp;nbsp;The&amp;nbsp;Mường people are basically ethnically Vietnamese but live in the mountainous areas of North-Central provinces such as Hoa Binh and Thanh Hoa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although considered a separate language from Vietnamese, many Vietnamese speakers will find they can understand much of the&amp;nbsp;Mường language without studying it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Trend of Vietnamese Youth Bicycling Cross Country - Interview with Tuoi Tre News</title>
    <link>http://www.saigonist.com/vietnam/trend-vietnamese-youth-bicycling-cross-country-interview-tuoi-tre-news</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Awhile ago, some time after I undertook a bicycle trek from Nha Trang to Mui Ne, I was contacted by a reporter from Tuoi Tre News to write something about it. Only a tiny bit of the information I provided was actually used and I&#039;ve since lost track of the article so I&#039;ll just post what I already wrote here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. How do you think about this new trend: travelling across the&lt;br /&gt;
country by bicycle. Is it popular in your country? Did you ever make&lt;br /&gt;
it or finish it shortly?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it really is a trend rather than just a few outlier cases, then I&lt;br /&gt;
think it&#039;s great and it should really be encouraged as a wholesome and&lt;br /&gt;
healthy activity as well as a way to travel. In the US, it&#039;s actually&lt;br /&gt;
not a common thing to do although there are clubs which regularly meet&lt;br /&gt;
and do long-distance rides together, which may also include camping,&lt;br /&gt;
if the weather is agreeable. But I would like to see more people in&lt;br /&gt;
Vietnam ride bicycles for sport and exercise and also as a means of&lt;br /&gt;
transportation, not just for slow but far journeys like the one we&lt;br /&gt;
took. Besides the possibility of extremely cold weather in my home&lt;br /&gt;
country, there are many other ways in which Vietnam is a more ideal&lt;br /&gt;
long distance cycling destination which I hope to blog about someday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My father is a cyclist and I joined him on a ride through forests and&lt;br /&gt;
countryside before I came to Vietnam. Unfortunately, I don&#039;t have a&lt;br /&gt;
bike to ride with me now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.  According to Vietnamese traditional lifestyle, youngsters all&lt;br /&gt;
should follow the same way: finishing school, going to work, getting&lt;br /&gt;
married and living in peace for the rest of their life. Youngsters who&lt;br /&gt;
choose to go other ways like: doing gap year, going through other&lt;br /&gt;
countries by bicycle in a long timeâ€¦ means something crazy and&lt;br /&gt;
undervalued. How do you think about this way of thought?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, I think most people can fit a cycling trip into an otherwise&lt;br /&gt;
traditional education since it can easily be organized during a break&lt;br /&gt;
and can be done on a budget. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s crazy at all, nor&lt;br /&gt;
should traveling to other countries or taking off for a gap year be&lt;br /&gt;
considered especially crazy. If you think so then your bar for what is&lt;br /&gt;
crazy is set too low. I do think that Vietnamese youth should be&lt;br /&gt;
willing to try new things and not constrain themselves only to what&lt;br /&gt;
the mass majority has done in the past. And definitely learn from what&lt;br /&gt;
people are doing around the world, not just the world around you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.   According to your opinion, what is the thing that youngsters&lt;br /&gt;
gained and you lost after this trip?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I lost some weight, haha. Otherwise, there&#039;s really nothing to lose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gained some new friends who I now have a lot of respect for. I&lt;br /&gt;
learned things about myself as well. Any time we travel we gain new&lt;br /&gt;
experiences as well as learn about ourselves. And of course seeing a&lt;br /&gt;
country at the slow pace of a bicycle is much different from a car on&lt;br /&gt;
a highway. On a bicycle, not only do you see the terrain but you feel&lt;br /&gt;
the gradients, the shade from every tree, and the difference in wind&lt;br /&gt;
from province to province. What I gained was a new perspective on&lt;br /&gt;
Vietnam and especially the Vietnamese people.&lt;/p&gt;

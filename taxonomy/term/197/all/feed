    <title>Irony of Protesting SOPA in Vietnam</title>
    <link>http://www.saigonist.com/b/irony-protesting-sopa-vietnam</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, Wikipedia, Google, and many other high profile websites are protesting the MPAA&#039;s Protect IP Act (PIPA, in the Senate) and the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA, in the House), two anti-piracy acts that they&#039;re trying to push into legislation in the US, which also threaten internet freedom.  Citizens of other countries should be concerned not just because much of the internet each of us uses runs in the US and so abides by US law, but because the wording that eventually passes will likely be copied by governments around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netizens in Vietnam have joined the cause or at least have spread word in support.  Stepping back, doing so is an act of irony from multiple perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, that we&#039;re protesting at all in a country where public protest is a privilege more than a right, that the Communist Party is seldom willing to confer.  In this case, there&#039;s little concern for the Party, since the object of protest is in America, and it&#039;s specifically an industry (Hollywood) which clearly gets no respect here - it&#039;s more convenient to buy pirated DVDs, two for a dollar, publicly on the street at tax-paying (or whatever it is they&#039;re paying, to whoever) businesses, than it is to download them online anyways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we&#039;re protesting because we don&#039;t want arbitrary websites to be taken down by the law without any due process.  If you&#039;re at all familiar with Vietnam&#039;s legal system, you&#039;ll already know that this is the case here.  Nominally, pornography is banned and this is why the government can block websites but if there are any porn sites that are blocked I&#039;m not aware.  If IP laws were enforced here, Zing would not exist.  But some websites are taken down occasionally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, we&#039;re using social media as our protest medium.  Social media and web technology make it really easy to join a protest; it only takes two clicks to share something on Facebook.  Except that Facebook itself is already &quot;blacked out&quot; in Vietnam.  And Facebook is by far the most commonly used form of social media in Vietnam.  And the protest is about internet censorship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point I want to make is that internet freedom is valuable and is a worthwhile cause for all people. For the people who are just now thinking about internet censorship issues, I hope they also become aware of it in a more immediate context, like a campaign to help starving Africans should also serve to bring about greater awareness of poverty closer to home.&lt;/p&gt;

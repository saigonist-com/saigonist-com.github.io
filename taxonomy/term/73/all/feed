    <title>Improved Google Spam Filter?</title>
    <link>http://www.saigonist.com/content/improved-google-spam-filter</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Google, in response to the flood of recent concern about spam/content farms showing up in their results, have just announced a big change in their system of algorithms which calculate page rankings.  They had previously published a Chrome plugin that lets you manually block results, and Google says the new algorithm blocks some 84% of the same sites that people were blocking with the plugin.  I guess some people were controversially blocking non-spammy sites, rather than guess that Google&#039;s algorithm isn&#039;t good enough.  Or isn&#039;t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matt Cutts, the main anti-spam guy at Google, says the new algorithm change affects 11.8% of queries.  Since the change is only effective in the US right now and I can browse from both Vietnam and the US, we can compare results and some one in eight queries should be improved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I tested &quot;dog shampoo&quot; out of the blue.  I have never had a dog because I think they smell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Vietnam, high ranking results included drnaturalvet.com which had a low quality page of filler about dog shampoo and dogshampoo.info which is clearly a made-for-adsense site.  In the US, the drnaturalvet link is much lower, but dogshampoo.info maintains the same high position.  A link to content farm ehow.com is also lower now. And a link to dogshampoo.co.uk, a made-for-adsense site with nothing about dog shampoo at the time of indexing (see cache) is now gone too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A search for winrar came up with fairly similar results in either country, and both maintained links to spam sites like software.informer.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A search for &quot;tightvnc server authentication successful closed connection&quot; punished duplicate content site pinoytech.org slightly but another duplicate/copy site efreedom.com maintained its position in the top 20.  Both copy the StackExchange site SuperUser.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it seems that the new algorithm change is an improvement, but I don&#039;t think it goes far enough to filter spammy results.  While it may be a slight setback for those guys, they are still in the running and will be emboldened to try to rank higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There may still be a need for users to crowdsource a database of filtered spam sites until further algorithm improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: The Atlantic did a similar test from India on &quot;is botox safe&quot; and &quot;drywall dust&quot; and found their results to be much improved.&lt;/p&gt;

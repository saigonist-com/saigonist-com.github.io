    <title>10 Days of Sitting: Vipassana Meditation in Vietnam</title>
    <link>http://www.saigonist.com/b/10-days-sitting-vipassana-meditation-vietnam</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;From the October 31st to November 11th I attended a Vipassana meditation course/retreat on the outskirts of Ho Chi Minh City. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the fourth day, we got to eat: yogurt. I was so happy that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Five Precepts: No killing, no stealing, no sexual misconduct, no lying, no drinking alcohol&lt;/h2&gt;

    <title>Vegetarian for a week in Vietnam</title>
    <link>http://www.saigonist.com/b/vegetarian-week-vietnam</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Rubbing my eyes, contact lenses still in, I slowly woke up to an orange sun just beginning its daily ascent. We were still on a bus, just about to arrive in Nha Trang after driving all night from Saigon, but waking up alive meant I&#039;d survived seven &lt;strong&gt;consecutive&lt;/strong&gt; days of being a vegetarian (coinciding with the start of a bicycle trek from Nha Trang to Saigon, an exercise in which I would need all the calories I could get, regardless of source - future blog post on that experience). Since then, in the name of science I did another one week stint as a vegetarian which led me to finish writing this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Vegetarian restaurants in Saigon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; marginheight=&quot;0&quot; marginwidth=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msa=0&amp;amp;msid=204240093931181227847.0004c016b59db93ffbc57&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;t=m&amp;amp;ll=10.783227,106.693897&amp;amp;spn=0.02951,0.038624&amp;amp;z=14&amp;amp;output=embed&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ Above is a map I made of vegetarian restaurants mostly around Districts 1, 3, and Binh Thanh. Red Markers indicated closed restaurants. Google and other online resources for Vietnam/Ho Chi Minh City are useful sources too but I always find them to be both lacking, inaccurate and, out of date, which means I&#039;ve wasted a lot of time looking for restaurants that no longer exist or have moved.  Feel free to suggest additions in the comments or let me know if you want to be a collaborator on the map and I&#039;ll give you access. I will only list restaurants that I have verified or which you can vouch for. The map will be updated periodically.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why eat vegetables and not animals in Vietnam?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With any luck, you should actually enjoy eating a healthier diet and feel better for it, both physically and mentally or spiritually. If you do convert to vegetarianism you should do it for yourself before any other reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not eating tons of meat has &lt;strong&gt;health benefits&lt;/strong&gt;. It will lower your risk for various diseases while you&#039;ll be eating more of the good nutrients you probably aren&#039;t getting enough of. You&#039;ll avoid more of the poisons like pesticides and heavy metals that accumulate in higher concentrations in animals. Vegetarian restaurants in Vietnam often go an extra step and refrain from using MSG in their food. (Next time you eat out in Vietnam, you&#039;ll be praying that Ajinomoto is the worst of all the additives used in most other restaurants.) Being vegetarian can be good for your &lt;strong&gt;conscience&lt;/strong&gt; too - less animal farming is better for the environment and uses less of our resources and not killing sentient beings is something they&#039;ll appreciate (although it&#039;s up for debate whether &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_in_invertebrates&quot;&gt;invertebrates feel pain&lt;/a&gt;). If you&#039;re Buddhist then you should be concerned about what Buddhism says about that last point. Otherwise, try not to let it bother you. Try not to think of a &lt;strong&gt;purple elephant&lt;/strong&gt; while you&#039;re at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;460&quot; height=&quot;259&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/dzj95jHuPiw&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you happen to meditate, you may be interested in knowing that vegetarians shoved in an fMRI machine show more empathy. Personally, I&#039;ve found myself feeling a bit more compassion for animals. From an enlightenment perspective, this extra push in compassion may help with your concentration, as meditation on compassion leads to improved concentration. (Thus compassion, beyond or despite its altruism, also shapes us into better human beings.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Vietnam, we should be especially concerned about what poisons may be going into our foods because when hearing reported seizures of &lt;strong&gt;rotten meat&lt;/strong&gt; for sale to consumers (40 tons of rotten meat seized in Thu Duc District in the first half of 2012) we know it&#039;s just the tip of the iceberg. Fear of death due to eating rotten chicken may be reason enough to vegetarianize yourself, when chicken is often undercooked here, not to mention Vietnam&#039;s own various raw meat dishes including the raw beef thrown in pho. Lack of refrigeration is common at the numerous informal restaurants and carts in Vietnam despite the tropical weather and, whereas vegetable dishes can go unrefrigerated for awhile, meat dishes will spoil quickly despite being cooked possibly hours before being served to and eaten by customers, with leftover lunch being kept in the afternoon heat to be served for dinner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meat in Vietnam is often served with skin and fat included, making it even less healthy (although it can also be more delicious this way). And sinewy Vietnamese beef doesn&#039;t even taste good, does it?! This is why beef imported from Australia or the US is available for a markup here, for even minimally discerning tastes. &lt;strong&gt;I would honestly not miss eating Vietnamese beef.&lt;/strong&gt; But Vietnamese people enjoy gnawing on chewy stuff, apparently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;float: right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://distilleryimage5.s3.amazonaws.com/0f5a051accb811e19b0622000a1e8a4f_6.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buddhists in Vietnam are also supposed to eat vegetarian once or twice a month, based on the lunar calendar, and can eat free vegetarian meals at pagodas on those days. The world is a better place for it on those days at least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vegetarians become aware of protein alternatives (e.g. broccoli, soy, beans, etc. although most beans are actually quite rare) and Vietnamese vegetarian restaurants have numerous mock meat dishes, some of which are rather convincing. How could you live in the south of Vietnam without eating &lt;strong&gt;&quot;cơm tấm&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;, broken rice served with grilled pork, shredded pork skin, and a slab of pork meatloaf? Thankfully, vegetarian restaurants in Saigon can do a convincing faux meat version (pictured above) of this signature dish and other Vietnamese favorites of mine like chả giò and canh khổ qua. Besides soy-based &quot;meat&quot;, Vietnamese use wheat gluten (mì căn) to make mock meats. I&#039;m impressed by what Vietnam has done with vegetarian (generally vegan) cuisine and want to encourage even more conversion of the low hanging fruit of Vietnamese cuisine into meatless versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, meals at Vietnamese restaurants might come with fresh herbs but lack vegetables beyond a measly slice of unripe tomato and cucumber. We all know we should be eating more vegetables and eating at a vegetarian restaurant is an easy way to inject some vitamins into our diets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;--&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Vietnamese Vegetarian Restaurants&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;float: right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://distilleryimage0.s3.amazonaws.com/0b9ab5fccfd611e18112123138100412_6.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saigon has vegetarian restaurants sprinkled throughout the city, from cheap (under a dollar per meal) to fancy (e.g. Hoa Dang a.k.a. Loving Hut).  But if you like to stay up late and eat late meals it can be harder to find your favorite veggie spot still serving - often the normal vegetarian &quot;com chay&quot; quans, like most restaurants in Vietnam, stop selling after lunch around 2:00 PM and start back up around 4:00, but then after 8:00 close for the day.  I work late at night which is normally not a big problem for food in Saigon where late night joints can be found throughout town. So a late night vegetarian restaurants would have at least one customer!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are basically two types of vegetarian restaurants in Vietnam. The most common is a &quot;quan com chay&quot; and they are easy to find all around the city. Just make sure it says &quot;cơm chay&quot; and not &quot;cơm cháy&quot; because the latter is a kind of crispy rice wafer., which may not be vegetarian at all. A quan com chay will generally have a cart in front with a buffet of a dozen or so vegetarian dishes such as tofu, mock meats, sauteed vegetables, greens, etc. to be eaten with rice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other kind of vegetarian restaurant is the proper restaurant with non-plastic chairs for seating, with air conditioning, where you will be shown a proper menu from which you will order dishes. This is where you&#039;d take guests whereas the former is where you&#039;d stop in for a quick meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Won&#039;t it suck?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Issues that might come up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hunger: Do you find regular Vietnamese portions to be too small, even after eating in Vietnam for awhile? Then it won&#039;t be better when eating vegetarian. I was used to it, and was already eating several vegetarian meals a week, but still felt hungry sometimes. But at most buffets you can choose to order more side dishes and even more rice. But Quan Thien Tam at 152 Ban Co, right off Dien Bien Phu in District 3, a 15000 VND rice plate is enough to satiate almost anyone&#039;s appetite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Craving for animal flesh: I recently quit smoking. Thinking about a specific meal containing meat sometimes does not compare to the desire to smoke a cigarette after you&#039;ve just quit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Availability: It&#039;s available all over Saigon as long as you don&#039;t need to eat after 9 PM or so! I did not restrict myself to a vegan diet so eggs and milk products were &quot;on the menu&quot; so it was possible to eat at many normal restaurants too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;float: left; padding-right: 10px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://distilleryimage4.s3.amazonaws.com/7ae8ce7ed53711e1ac8422000a1e95e1_6.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is bún chả giò, rice noodles tossed with fried spring rolls and some bean sprouts and herbs, like salad with fish sauce as the dressing. Except the fish sauce here isn&#039;t made from fish and the spring rolls have tubers and other plans as ingredients instead of pork. It&#039;s delicious aka &quot;ngon&quot; in Vietnamese.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Buddhism in Vietnam</title>
    <link>http://www.saigonist.com/b/buddhism-vietnam</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/38/Th%C3%ADch_Qu%E1%BA%A3ng_%C4%90%E1%BB%A9c_self-immolation.jpg/300px-Th%C3%ADch_Qu%E1%BA%A3ng_%C4%90%E1%BB%A9c_self-immolation.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curious about Buddhism in Vietnam? So was I.  When you look around the country you would just about assume that everyone was Buddhist.  Until recently, I was only taking in these &quot;Buddhisms&quot; as just another dish in the realm of Vietnamese culture that makes the country so different from the West.  But there are also Christian churches (some 10% of the population) as well as a long tradition of Islam within certain ethnic minorities like the Cham who form Muslim communities in their provincial strongholds as well as in the city. There&#039;s also a unique indigenous religion called Cao Đài that basically mixes Buddhism and an Abrahamic God. Still it&#039;s clear that Vietnam is a predominantly Buddhist country in both religion and culture and it has been for most of known recorded history (notably, there was a dark and critically damaging period for Buddhism in Vietnam when Roman Catholics controlled the Southern Vietnamese government, more on the issue of religious intolerance in another future post perhaps).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What kind or sect of Buddhism?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When one thinks of Christians, they are a diverse group that identify much more with being Catholic or Protestant or Mormon or whatever else more than just being a Christian.  It seems every major world religion has similarly broken down over the years into sects that started believing all kinds of things that weren&#039;t there at the founding of the religion, and who differentiate themselves from other sects through these new and unique beliefs. While people in Vietnam seem to just think they are Buddhist rather than any special kind of Buddhist, Buddhism itself, as I&#039;ve found, has not been immune from such corruption -- or innovation, depending on how you look at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you think of Buddhism as just an aspect of being Vietnamese, you don&#039;t think much about how Vietnamese Buddhism relates to Buddhism in other countries but in fact it does have its own characteristics. If you split Buddhists into the two main branches, Mahayana (Greater Vehicle) and Theravada, Vietnam falls into Mahayana along with the rest of China&#039;s historical sphere of influence (the CJKV countries, ethnic Chinese countries like Singapore and Taiwan, and neighbors like Tibet, Nepal, and Mongolia). The Southeast Asian Buddhist countries (Thailand, Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia) are all Theravadin except for Vietnam. What is relatively unknown is that Vietnam does have Theravada Buddhism among the million or so Khmer (Cambodian) population concentrated in the Mekong Delta as well as with a small number of ethnic Kinh (Vietnamese are mostly ethnically Kinh) who have their own Theravadin temples. There is also a third, newer branch called Vajrayana a.k.a. the Diamond Vehicle (Kim cương thừa or Mật tông in Vietnamese), Esoteric Buddhism, or Tantric Buddhism. There are some small centers teaching Vajrayana scattered throughout the country including ones (associated with Diamond Way Centers) run by foreigners. Otherwise, Vajrayana doesn&#039;t lie in Vietnamese Buddhist tradition the same way as Mahayana.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But unlike a Catholic or Protestant, a Vietnamese Buddhist might not really identify with any sect of Buddhism. If you ask them, they might not even know. And Theravadin Buddhists and Mahayana Buddhists can actually be Buddhist buddies together in the same places without any conflict. Vietnamese Buddhists are generally some mixture of Pure Land and Tientai for most people (laypeople) which involves mostly chanting, burning stuff, ringing bells, and praying, or Vietnamese Zen (Thiền-Na or more commonly just Thiền), which is mostly for monks and is where meditation is found.  The two types of Buddhism live side by side and are mixed into a unified Zen-Pure Land Buddhism and this doesn&#039;t seem to bother anyone. Vietnamese might not even identify themselves as Buddhist, although they will still have a mix of Buddhist, Confucian, and ancestor-worship beliefs and practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;float: right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://distilleryimage5.s3.amazonaws.com/2f124946c31f11e1a39b1231381b7ba1_6.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Nam Mô A Di Đà Phật&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common chant or prayer used by Vietnamese Buddhists is &quot;Nam Mô A Di Đà Phật&quot; which is a call (somewhat like seeking refuge) to the A Di Da (Amitābha) Buddha, who was a, but not the, Buddha. By calling out his name it is said you will be born in the Pure Land (tịnh độ) when you die, where you can more easily attain enlightenment. To me, it sounds a lot like Jesus. However, chanting can also be similar to Buddhist meditation practices by instilling a sort of mindfulness.  Anyways, that line is just the first part of a longer prayer which is meaningless in Vietnamese but was transcribed (via Chinese) from Sanskrit. You can find it in small booklets found, among other places, in some vegetarian restaurants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vietnamese Buddhist laypersons are mostly not vegetarian, but once a month (although preferably six days a month) Buddhists will abstain from animal food products. On these days, which occur at midpoints in the lunar month, many local restaurants especially those near temples will serve vegetarian dishes. Vegetarian restaurants will be packed, but temples will also provide vegetarian meals, sometimes for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Thích Nhất Hạnh&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last piece I&#039;ll cover in this introduction to Vietnamese Buddhism is the aspect of Vietnamese Buddhism outside of Vietnam. In America, Buddhism came to be known from Asian immigrants and especially from certain Americans going over to Japan after the war and learning about Japanese Zen. [If there are stories of American War Veterans bringing Vietnamese Buddhism back to the States, I&#039;d love to hear about it.] Buddhism in Japan had itself spread from China which had received it from India. Likewise, Tibetan Buddhism has also spread to the Western world after exiled Tibetans fled to India where they came into contact with traveling hippies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vietnamese Buddhists have also had their influence around the world although mostly through a single enigmatic figure rather than a school of thought. This person would be Thich Nhat Hanh (random aside: Thích is the &quot;family name&quot; taken by Vietnamese Buddhists when they become monks and it comes from Thích-ca Mâu-ni or Shakyamuni, the Buddha). Thich Nhat Hanh comes from Vietnamese Rinzai lineage, but today he is said to no longer represents any kind of contemporary Vietnamese Buddhism. Sadly, he is also not allowed to freely return to Vietnam despite being one of the world&#039;s greatest living Zen masters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another Vietnamese monk who came to be known around the world was one Thích Quảng Đức. It was not his teachings that brought him fame but his self-immolation in protest of religious persecution which became a major event in the end of American support for the South Vietnamese government. A large memorial park was recently constructed at the intersection of Cach Mang Thang 8 and Nguyen Dinh Chieu in District 3 where Thich Quang Duc set himself on fire. Today, as Tibetan monks self-immolate in increasing numbers, also in protest of a certain government, they might learn a thing or two about PR from the Vietnamese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But like other waves of Asian immigration before, the post-Vietnam War flood of Vietnamese into the US eventually led to temples in maturing Vietnamese communities everywhere in the country. I believe these temples mostly serve to memorialize ancestors and as community centers now but some do serve to teach practical Buddhist teachings that can be useful to more than just Vietnamese immigrants. Today they don&#039;t hold the cachet that, say, Japanese-style Zen centers have. But I am, with the help of some good friends, gradually discovering the traditions in Vietnam that have been passed down and were able to foster such great masters of whom Thich Nhat Hanh and Thich Quang Duc are only two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;float: right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://distilleryimage10.s3.amazonaws.com/da9a9a64ba2011e19dc71231380fe523_6.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thien Vien Truc Lam, Da Lat.&lt;/p&gt;

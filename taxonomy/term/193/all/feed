    <title>Barcamping is easy and 3 other ideas</title>
    <link>http://www.saigonist.com/b/barcamping-easy-and-3-other-ideas</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;BarCampSaigon Winter 2011 was a success by most measures, comparable to the previous one. There were a lot of registrations, a lot of attendees, and a lot of sessions.  We fed, clothed, and caffeinated hundreds of people and found sponsors willing to pay for it all.  We didn&#039;t lose money (making money isn&#039;t possible, but losing money is). Yet something about it has been bothering me since last Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barcamping is easy; Easy to attend; Even easy to organize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, it can be easy to organize a BarCamp. But, I think, it&#039;s really difficult to organize BarCamps (plural).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For one, most people who like the idea of organizing a BarCamp like the idea exactly once.  It&#039;s hard to keep the fire going.  The first BarCamp Saigon flame nearly died out - some embers turned into a second generation.  But BarCamp Hanoi&#039;s flame has already disappeared.  These are unrecognized failures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem, as I see it, is that this BarCamp didn&#039;t necessarily ensure that another BarCamp would happen, and I think just continued to fuel the myth among people that BarCamps will happen magically and automatically, that they will get a free meal and t-shirt again.  After some thought, these three distillations occurred to me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. barcamp should beget barcamp.&lt;br /&gt;
2. barcamp should be the beginning - not the end.&lt;br /&gt;
3. barcamp should be the exception - not the rule. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let me explain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. BarCampSaigon should be the genesis of the next BarCampSaigon, and also BarCamps in other Vietnamese cities - BarCampCanTho, BarCampDaNang, BarCampDaLat.  People should understand what a BarCamp is enough to organize simple ones in their hometowns, and do it without worrying about significant funding or caring how many people will show up. Clothing and caffeination optional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Things should start at BarCamp. Ideas should be formed and relationships forged out of discussions among people who should have been meeting more regularly but hadn&#039;t. It shouldn&#039;t be a place to launch or announce your finished product, although if you started from a previous BarCamp that would be thrilling news.  Sessions should not just lead to greater understanding, but cause new questions and avenues of inquiry to be developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. BarCamp is the unconference.  But it&#039;s also become the premier tech conference in Saigon. I think there should be large tech conferences here covering the major topics that are presented on at BarCampSaigon.  And BarCampSaigon should be the place for importing new foreign and emerging ideas, which should then one day get full conferences of their own, so that BCSG can be a platform for further more ideas which need sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These three goals aren&#039;t officially BarCamp&#039;s raison d&#039;etre, nor are they the only important ingredients in a BarCamp.  The meat of the camp does matter: the number and quality of sessions and people leading them so that people buzz about the next BarCamp; food and coffee and beer to get people to sit down communally; design of t-shirts and other assets to make the event come off professional; and convincing sponsors to make it all happen.  I would like to have more thoughts about how those ingredients can coincide with the above three ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Saigon Street Food - A Virtual Culinary Tour</title>
    <link>http://www.saigonist.com/vietnam/hcmc/saigon-street-food-virtual-culinary-tour</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Let&#039;s set some ground rules: Street food must be eaten on the sidewalk without the option of eating indoors, as many &quot;proper&quot; restaurants also have outdoor seating, even though such &quot;al fresco&quot; appropriations of the street are actually illegal and subject to periodic police inspections where illegally placed plastic chairs and tables are confiscated. For Vietnamese small business owners who don&#039;t even rent space inside any buildings, their whole business depends on police not cracking down on them. Perhaps a better solution would be a non-corrupt (haha) registration and hygiene inspection process for street food vendors, then the government could get some tax income, the business owners would have some stability, and the consumers would get some level of food safety. But for now, let&#039;s get back to reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. &lt;strong&gt;Banh Xeo&lt;/strong&gt; - often translated as Vietnamese pancakes or Vietnamese crepes. Like pancakes or crepes, a batter is poured into a circular pan to crispen a thin round layer of this &quot;cake&quot; which has toppings like shrimp and pork, bean sprouts, and sometimes mushrooms (but not so much in the street). Banh Xeo Mien Trung is a smaller version. You can try this on Phan Ke Binh Street (near DeciBel) and Ung Van Khiem Street near D2 in Binh Thanh District.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. &lt;strong&gt;Banh Mi Thit&lt;/strong&gt; - the Vietnamese submarine sandwich / roll. Next to pho, this is probably the most famous Vietnamese dish outside of Vietnam. A French bread roll spread with pate (both foods from the French colonial era) stuffed with some kind of meat, julienned carrots and pickled daikon, cilantro - and some fresh and extremely spicy chili peppers if you don&#039;t remember to ask them &quot;khong ot&quot;. Vo Van Tan near Cach Mang Thang 8 in District 3 has a popular shop to get some takeaway banh mi thit. Also try Banh Mi Heo Quay, pork with delicious -crispy- fat and skin attached, available on Ngo Tat To Street in Binh Thanh District.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. &lt;strong&gt;Mi Hoanh Thanh&lt;/strong&gt; - Chinese Won Ton Ramen Noodle Cart. Also seemingly referred to as &quot;van than&quot; in the North Vietnamese dialect. &quot;Mi&quot; refers to ramen noodles and if you think ramen means cheap instant noodles then you need to get schooled. Often these will be served in fancy wooden noodle carts which you can also sit at. The noodles should be fresh, not instant industrially dried noodles. Hoanh Thanh are won ton noodle dumplings. Also try Mi Xa Xiu - &quot;char siu&quot; in Chinese or cha-shu in Japanese. Try it at the corner of Xo Viet Nghe Tinh right after the Thi Nghe Bridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. &lt;strong&gt;Banh Khot&lt;/strong&gt; - Banh Khot is similar to Banh Xeo but thicker with a much smaller diameter. Too similar for me to distinguish is another dish called Banh Canh, not to be confused with the similarly pronounced Banh Canh noodle dish. Like Banh Xeo, after the batter and toppings are fired in their clay vessels they are wrapped by your hands in lettuce or mustard greens and rice paper, topped with fresh herbs, and then dipped in fish sauce. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. &lt;strong&gt;Hu Tiu (Nam Vang), Hu Tiu Go&lt;/strong&gt; - Hu Tiu (or Hu Tieu) is a kind of noodle. Hu Tiu Nam Vang refers to a version of this noodle dish, which can be eaten in soup or &quot;dry&quot;, which should be Khmer - Nam Vang is an old Vietnamese word for Phnom Penh. Hu Tiu Go isn&#039;t a flavor of Hu Tiu. Rather it refers to the way it is sold. Go means to knock, and a seller of Hu Tiu Go will push his cart down the street while knocking on wood to let people know he&#039;s coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6. &lt;strong&gt;Banh Trang Tron&lt;/strong&gt; - A favorite after school snack of Vietnamese girls. A trail mix of rice paper, herbs, chili chopped up and mixed with dried beef or quail eggs and served in a plastic bag with two small sticks to be used like chopsticks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7. &lt;strong&gt;Com Tam&lt;/strong&gt; - broken rice, a traditional South Vietnamese breakfast as opposed to pho in the North. Using the broken grains of rice served with BBQ pork (suon), sunny-side up egg (op-la), (bi), (cha), and with fish sauce (nuoc mam) dripped over to taste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8. &lt;strong&gt;Xoi&lt;/strong&gt; - Sticky rice. Can be served with separated chicken as easily as with ripe mango or other sweets. A favorite of mine is Xoi Khuc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9. &lt;strong&gt;Bot Chien&lt;/strong&gt; - What look like mochi cubes are thrown in a wok and fried with an egg or two into an omelette with fried cubes of... what exactly? Photo attached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10. &lt;strong&gt;Banh Cuon&lt;/strong&gt; - Kind of like a giant round noodle. Banh in Vietnamese can mean many things although it&#039;s often translated to cake. It can also mean bread and sometimes the noodle in a noodle dish. Banh Cuon is some kind of batter steamed in a giant circle until it&#039;s hard and noodley then topped with something like ground beef (or seafood or chicke and mushrooms if you want to get fancy). Then you add some &quot;cha&quot;, herbs, and bean sprouts and pour on the nuoc mam and put it all into your mouth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11. &lt;strong&gt;Bo La Lot&lt;/strong&gt; - This one almost killed me. Street food is all fun and games until you are vomiting out both ends of your body for 24 hours. This dish of mystery beef wrapped in &quot;lot&quot; leaves and then cooked over coals, then wrapped in rice paper or greens and topped with thinly sliced papaya or unripe bananas and other leaves, can be quite tasty. But take it from me: avoid buying it from the sidewalk sellers on Ton Duc Thang Street right at the beginning of Le Thanh Ton Street.&lt;br /&gt;
Drink&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Refreshments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nuoc Mia&lt;/strong&gt; - The quintessential street drink. Sugar cane juice made by running sticks of sugar cane through a press. When I first started drinking this it was availale for 2000 VND/glass but now it&#039;s no less than 4000 VND, which still comes out to less than 20 cents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sinh To&lt;/strong&gt; - fruit smoothies. Strawberry, tomato, avacado, custard apple, banana, mango, etc. Go to the Hang Xanh Roundabout (aka The Circle of Death) after midnight if you&#039;re bored and thirsty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trai Dua&lt;/strong&gt; - This is not even street food, it&#039;s jungle food. In the Mekong Delta, in provinces like Ben Tre, this magical fruit literally grows on trees. Coconuts can be drunk anywhere as long as you have a way to crack them open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tra Chanh&lt;/strong&gt; - This is a street drink but it&#039;s not a Saigon street drink. Next time I will write about drinking this lemon tea on the streets of Hanoi.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vegetarian for a week in Vietnam</title>
    <link>http://www.saigonist.com/b/vegetarian-week-vietnam</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Rubbing my eyes, contact lenses still in, I slowly woke up to an orange sun just beginning its daily ascent. We were still on a bus, just about to arrive in Nha Trang after driving all night from Saigon, but waking up alive meant I&#039;d survived seven &lt;strong&gt;consecutive&lt;/strong&gt; days of being a vegetarian (coinciding with the start of a bicycle trek from Nha Trang to Saigon, an exercise in which I would need all the calories I could get, regardless of source - future blog post on that experience). Since then, in the name of science I did another one week stint as a vegetarian which led me to finish writing this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Vegetarian restaurants in Saigon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; marginheight=&quot;0&quot; marginwidth=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msa=0&amp;amp;msid=204240093931181227847.0004c016b59db93ffbc57&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;t=m&amp;amp;ll=10.783227,106.693897&amp;amp;spn=0.02951,0.038624&amp;amp;z=14&amp;amp;output=embed&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ Above is a map I made of vegetarian restaurants mostly around Districts 1, 3, and Binh Thanh. Red Markers indicated closed restaurants. Google and other online resources for Vietnam/Ho Chi Minh City are useful sources too but I always find them to be both lacking, inaccurate and, out of date, which means I&#039;ve wasted a lot of time looking for restaurants that no longer exist or have moved.  Feel free to suggest additions in the comments or let me know if you want to be a collaborator on the map and I&#039;ll give you access. I will only list restaurants that I have verified or which you can vouch for. The map will be updated periodically.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why eat vegetables and not animals in Vietnam?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With any luck, you should actually enjoy eating a healthier diet and feel better for it, both physically and mentally or spiritually. If you do convert to vegetarianism you should do it for yourself before any other reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not eating tons of meat has &lt;strong&gt;health benefits&lt;/strong&gt;. It will lower your risk for various diseases while you&#039;ll be eating more of the good nutrients you probably aren&#039;t getting enough of. You&#039;ll avoid more of the poisons like pesticides and heavy metals that accumulate in higher concentrations in animals. Vegetarian restaurants in Vietnam often go an extra step and refrain from using MSG in their food. (Next time you eat out in Vietnam, you&#039;ll be praying that Ajinomoto is the worst of all the additives used in most other restaurants.) Being vegetarian can be good for your &lt;strong&gt;conscience&lt;/strong&gt; too - less animal farming is better for the environment and uses less of our resources and not killing sentient beings is something they&#039;ll appreciate (although it&#039;s up for debate whether &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_in_invertebrates&quot;&gt;invertebrates feel pain&lt;/a&gt;). If you&#039;re Buddhist then you should be concerned about what Buddhism says about that last point. Otherwise, try not to let it bother you. Try not to think of a &lt;strong&gt;purple elephant&lt;/strong&gt; while you&#039;re at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;460&quot; height=&quot;259&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/dzj95jHuPiw&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you happen to meditate, you may be interested in knowing that vegetarians shoved in an fMRI machine show more empathy. Personally, I&#039;ve found myself feeling a bit more compassion for animals. From an enlightenment perspective, this extra push in compassion may help with your concentration, as meditation on compassion leads to improved concentration. (Thus compassion, beyond or despite its altruism, also shapes us into better human beings.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Vietnam, we should be especially concerned about what poisons may be going into our foods because when hearing reported seizures of &lt;strong&gt;rotten meat&lt;/strong&gt; for sale to consumers (40 tons of rotten meat seized in Thu Duc District in the first half of 2012) we know it&#039;s just the tip of the iceberg. Fear of death due to eating rotten chicken may be reason enough to vegetarianize yourself, when chicken is often undercooked here, not to mention Vietnam&#039;s own various raw meat dishes including the raw beef thrown in pho. Lack of refrigeration is common at the numerous informal restaurants and carts in Vietnam despite the tropical weather and, whereas vegetable dishes can go unrefrigerated for awhile, meat dishes will spoil quickly despite being cooked possibly hours before being served to and eaten by customers, with leftover lunch being kept in the afternoon heat to be served for dinner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meat in Vietnam is often served with skin and fat included, making it even less healthy (although it can also be more delicious this way). And sinewy Vietnamese beef doesn&#039;t even taste good, does it?! This is why beef imported from Australia or the US is available for a markup here, for even minimally discerning tastes. &lt;strong&gt;I would honestly not miss eating Vietnamese beef.&lt;/strong&gt; But Vietnamese people enjoy gnawing on chewy stuff, apparently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;float: right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://distilleryimage5.s3.amazonaws.com/0f5a051accb811e19b0622000a1e8a4f_6.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buddhists in Vietnam are also supposed to eat vegetarian once or twice a month, based on the lunar calendar, and can eat free vegetarian meals at pagodas on those days. The world is a better place for it on those days at least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vegetarians become aware of protein alternatives (e.g. broccoli, soy, beans, etc. although most beans are actually quite rare) and Vietnamese vegetarian restaurants have numerous mock meat dishes, some of which are rather convincing. How could you live in the south of Vietnam without eating &lt;strong&gt;&quot;cơm tấm&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;, broken rice served with grilled pork, shredded pork skin, and a slab of pork meatloaf? Thankfully, vegetarian restaurants in Saigon can do a convincing faux meat version (pictured above) of this signature dish and other Vietnamese favorites of mine like chả giò and canh khổ qua. Besides soy-based &quot;meat&quot;, Vietnamese use wheat gluten (mì căn) to make mock meats. I&#039;m impressed by what Vietnam has done with vegetarian (generally vegan) cuisine and want to encourage even more conversion of the low hanging fruit of Vietnamese cuisine into meatless versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, meals at Vietnamese restaurants might come with fresh herbs but lack vegetables beyond a measly slice of unripe tomato and cucumber. We all know we should be eating more vegetables and eating at a vegetarian restaurant is an easy way to inject some vitamins into our diets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;--&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Vietnamese Vegetarian Restaurants&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;float: right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://distilleryimage0.s3.amazonaws.com/0b9ab5fccfd611e18112123138100412_6.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saigon has vegetarian restaurants sprinkled throughout the city, from cheap (under a dollar per meal) to fancy (e.g. Hoa Dang a.k.a. Loving Hut).  But if you like to stay up late and eat late meals it can be harder to find your favorite veggie spot still serving - often the normal vegetarian &quot;com chay&quot; quans, like most restaurants in Vietnam, stop selling after lunch around 2:00 PM and start back up around 4:00, but then after 8:00 close for the day.  I work late at night which is normally not a big problem for food in Saigon where late night joints can be found throughout town. So a late night vegetarian restaurants would have at least one customer!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are basically two types of vegetarian restaurants in Vietnam. The most common is a &quot;quan com chay&quot; and they are easy to find all around the city. Just make sure it says &quot;cơm chay&quot; and not &quot;cơm cháy&quot; because the latter is a kind of crispy rice wafer., which may not be vegetarian at all. A quan com chay will generally have a cart in front with a buffet of a dozen or so vegetarian dishes such as tofu, mock meats, sauteed vegetables, greens, etc. to be eaten with rice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other kind of vegetarian restaurant is the proper restaurant with non-plastic chairs for seating, with air conditioning, where you will be shown a proper menu from which you will order dishes. This is where you&#039;d take guests whereas the former is where you&#039;d stop in for a quick meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Won&#039;t it suck?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Issues that might come up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hunger: Do you find regular Vietnamese portions to be too small, even after eating in Vietnam for awhile? Then it won&#039;t be better when eating vegetarian. I was used to it, and was already eating several vegetarian meals a week, but still felt hungry sometimes. But at most buffets you can choose to order more side dishes and even more rice. But Quan Thien Tam at 152 Ban Co, right off Dien Bien Phu in District 3, a 15000 VND rice plate is enough to satiate almost anyone&#039;s appetite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Craving for animal flesh: I recently quit smoking. Thinking about a specific meal containing meat sometimes does not compare to the desire to smoke a cigarette after you&#039;ve just quit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Availability: It&#039;s available all over Saigon as long as you don&#039;t need to eat after 9 PM or so! I did not restrict myself to a vegan diet so eggs and milk products were &quot;on the menu&quot; so it was possible to eat at many normal restaurants too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;float: left; padding-right: 10px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://distilleryimage4.s3.amazonaws.com/7ae8ce7ed53711e1ac8422000a1e95e1_6.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is bún chả giò, rice noodles tossed with fried spring rolls and some bean sprouts and herbs, like salad with fish sauce as the dressing. Except the fish sauce here isn&#039;t made from fish and the spring rolls have tubers and other plans as ingredients instead of pork. It&#039;s delicious aka &quot;ngon&quot; in Vietnamese.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Improved Google Spam Filter?</title>
    <link>http://www.saigonist.com/content/improved-google-spam-filter</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Google, in response to the flood of recent concern about spam/content farms showing up in their results, have just announced a big change in their system of algorithms which calculate page rankings.  They had previously published a Chrome plugin that lets you manually block results, and Google says the new algorithm blocks some 84% of the same sites that people were blocking with the plugin.  I guess some people were controversially blocking non-spammy sites, rather than guess that Google&#039;s algorithm isn&#039;t good enough.  Or isn&#039;t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matt Cutts, the main anti-spam guy at Google, says the new algorithm change affects 11.8% of queries.  Since the change is only effective in the US right now and I can browse from both Vietnam and the US, we can compare results and some one in eight queries should be improved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I tested &quot;dog shampoo&quot; out of the blue.  I have never had a dog because I think they smell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Vietnam, high ranking results included drnaturalvet.com which had a low quality page of filler about dog shampoo and dogshampoo.info which is clearly a made-for-adsense site.  In the US, the drnaturalvet link is much lower, but dogshampoo.info maintains the same high position.  A link to content farm ehow.com is also lower now. And a link to dogshampoo.co.uk, a made-for-adsense site with nothing about dog shampoo at the time of indexing (see cache) is now gone too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A search for winrar came up with fairly similar results in either country, and both maintained links to spam sites like software.informer.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A search for &quot;tightvnc server authentication successful closed connection&quot; punished duplicate content site pinoytech.org slightly but another duplicate/copy site efreedom.com maintained its position in the top 20.  Both copy the StackExchange site SuperUser.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it seems that the new algorithm change is an improvement, but I don&#039;t think it goes far enough to filter spammy results.  While it may be a slight setback for those guys, they are still in the running and will be emboldened to try to rank higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There may still be a need for users to crowdsource a database of filtered spam sites until further algorithm improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: The Atlantic did a similar test from India on &quot;is botox safe&quot; and &quot;drywall dust&quot; and found their results to be much improved.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Spam / Content Farm Filter</title>
    <link>http://www.saigonist.com/content/google-spam-content-farm-filter</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;There&#039;s been a lot of talk about the decrease in quality of Google search results over the years due to spammers / content farms with strong SEO skills.  I&#039;m glad I&#039;m not the one who&#039;s been annoyed by this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google should know which sites are spam, content farms, or duplicated content.  That they aren&#039;t properly filtering or demoting them could be due to a conflict of interest - they make money from the ads on those crap sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we, as individuals, can easily distinguish the spam results from the quality ones and we do so everyday.  If only there were a way to stop duplicating this effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Google won&#039;t do this for us, then we can do this ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#039;s what I want:&lt;br /&gt;
1. When I&#039;ve been tricked into opening an ad-filled page without meaningful content, I want to go back to Google and mark that link as &quot;spam&quot;, have that noted somewhere in the cloud so I can access it from any computer, and have future search queries filter out that link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. I probably don&#039;t want to see any pages from that domain show up on any other queries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. I probably don&#039;t want to see any pages that my friends have also marked as spam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. I probably don&#039;t want to see any pages that friends of my friends have also marked as spam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. I may even want to befriend / &quot;follow&quot; strangers just because they&#039;re good at marking spam.&lt;/p&gt;

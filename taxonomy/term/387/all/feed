&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ve been doing a lot of traveling for nerdy reasons lately. A month ago it was BarCamp Yangon. This past weekend it was FOSSASIA in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. I&#039;ll get back to writing about living in Vietnam soon, since I&#039;ll be traveling around the country.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Gambling and Casinos - Vietnam&#039;s underground pasttime</title>
    <link>http://www.saigonist.com/vietnam/hcmc/gambling-and-casinos-vietnams-underground-pasttime</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Vietnamese people love gambling. If there&#039;s anything Vietnamese people are famous for it&#039;s (in order): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Nail salons&lt;br /&gt;
2. Pho&lt;br /&gt;
3. Gambling&lt;br /&gt;
4. Maybe a long off 4th would be: Billiards&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The surprising thing is that there aren&#039;t really that many nail salons in Vietnam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Vietnamese government, probably rightfully so, have decided that Vietnamese people should not be allowed to gamble. But unlike America, where casinos are banned from existing in most cities and states (which is why Las Vegas, a place in the middle of the desert, initially attracts people from across the country), there are actually a lot of casinos legally operating in Ho Chi Minh City - in all, &lt;strong&gt;43&lt;/strong&gt; gambling establishments concentrated in Hanoi and Saigon. But local Vietnamese are not allowed to step foot in them except to work inside them. Viet Kieu who have foreign passports can come though. Casinos are inside many of the big 5-star (down to 3-star) hotels like Caravelle, Majestic, New World Hotel, Equatorial Hotel in District 5, Movenpick Hotel in Phu Nhuan, etc. Saigon&#039;s casinos are all fairly small and nothing like Vegas (or even Macau). They are usually empty when I randomly check them out - purely for research purposes. They may be completely electronic, including all card games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I was saying, Vietnamese people love to gamble. Poor people don&#039;t need to beg for money in Vietnam because they can instead sell lottery tickets which everyone buys. &lt;strong&gt;Vietnamese people don&#039;t consider buying lottery tickets gambling.&lt;/strong&gt; You can see card games, what they do consider gambling, in action at Tet. For the few days of Tet, every house in Vietnam turns into a casino. Kids are taught how to gamble (but not necessarily how to gamble well) and they gamble away the &quot;&lt;strong&gt;lucky money&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; they receive from parents and other elders. For those few days, people are allowed to concentrate in small alleys and play card games for money and the police don&#039;t care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the year, Vietnamese who want to bet on cards have another choice: make a run for the border town of Bavet (remember to enable 3G on your Cambodian MetFone account) in Cambodia&#039;s Svay Rieng province, just across from Moc Bai, which itself is just outside of Ho Chi Minh City. You can take a Saigon city bus from downtown Ben Thanh Market to Moc Bai and then walk across the border. What you&#039;ll be greeted with is a single drag with almost nothing but shabby casino buildings with names like Le Macau. In this area, your phone&#039;s Vietnamese sim card will probably still work, people will be fluent in both Khmer and Vietnamese, and stores will accept Vietnamese dong as well as riel or dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inside a Bavet casino you&#039;ll find the standard casino card games like blackjack (or Vietnamese &quot;xi dach&quot; / &quot;xi lac&quot;), poker, baccarat, and slot machines. At the casinos for rich gamblers the food and drinks will be free. You&#039;ll also find cock fighting (da ga) inside the casinos! Vietnamese people also love betting on sports and there are also a number of online Vietnamese sites where they can transfer money and bet on football matches. Strangely, these websites are very popular yet aren&#039;t &lt;strong&gt;blocked by the ISPs&lt;/strong&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The downside to having a mini-Vegas right across the border of the country&#039;s largest and richest city:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many Vietnamese gamblers are not very successful at it. They borrow money to go to casinos in Cambodia and then lose. When they lose, they either try to borrow more money (loan sharks right there in Bavet are willing to lend losers money) or they find some other way to access money. When they lose all that money then they have to deal with the mafia elements common to any numbers racket. They will be held for ransom. If they have daughters, people will be sent into Vietnam to kidnap the bettor&#039;s daughter who will then be sold into prostitution to pay off her father&#039;s debt. If they win, they can use their winnings to pay for the favors of the daughter of another past gambler. You can also buy drugs (mostly ecstacy) to ply your short-time lover with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess this is what Hanoi&#039;s morality police want to discourage by banning casinos from serving Vietnamese people.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Medical tourism to and from Vietnam: Which hospitals should an expat in Vietnam go to for treatment?    </title>
    <link>http://www.saigonist.com/b/medical-tourism-and-vietnam-which-hospitals-should-expat-vietnam-go-treatment</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;
A hospice is where you go to die. Too often, a hospital is the same thing. And it&#039;s by design!  Where else do you see concentrated so many germ-infested people with weakened immune systems concentrate in one place coughing all over each other? I heard once that half of hospital deaths, probably moreso in developing countries, could be attributed to unclean water and subsequent diarrheal disease. One of the most effective things a doctor can do is wash his hands. But a number of doctors and other hospital staff can&#039;t even be bothered to use soap. Beyond that, what else sets one hospital apart from another?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
One thing foreigners in Vietnam worry about is quality healthcare, especially if they are retirees or have families with children. The quality of hospitals in Vietnam is increasing as the country has been developing over the past two decades but it&#039;s far from the standards of developed countries, including Asian neighbors who were once provincial backwaters compared to Saigon. The Vietnamese and foreign doctors working in Vietnam are surely capable of most quotidian treatments and non-complex surgeries but for more serious treatment many expats opt to fly out of Vietnam. Bumangrad Hospital in Bangkok is the hospital of choice for many expats in Vietnam and they&#039;re used to accepting medical tourists. One day, the Vietnamese tourism industry will figure out that people, without wasting further money on marketing, will come back to your country if you provide them good service the first time.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The question is: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Where are the region&#039;s best hospitals?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And the follow-up question: How do you determine how good a hospital is?
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Country&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Best&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Average top 10&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Average top 5&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Taiwan&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;19&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;189&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;99&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Japan&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;37&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;199&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;88&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Thailand&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;85&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;630&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;370&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Singapore&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;189&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;705&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;426&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Hong Kong&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;53&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;2006&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1137&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Philippines&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;210&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;2959&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1654&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Vietnam&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;2255&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;4210&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;2692&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Cambodia&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;12713&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;*&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;12992&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Myanmar/Burma&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;15396&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;**&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;**&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
                                                        
The above data was collected from hospitals.webometrics.info&#039;s January 2012 world rankings of some 17000 hospitals. You can read more about their ranking there, which isn&#039;t necessarily directly scoring the quality of a hospital and requires that the hospital has some presence online. One can only make assumptions about the quality of any hospital that doesn&#039;t have even a basic website these days. While most of the best hospitals in the world are in the United States, many are also in Japan. And I don&#039;t think any eastern/oriental medicine clinics are included here.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Countries are sorted by the average score of their top 10 hospitals. A hospital&#039;s score is based on how much research they do. I guess research hospitals are good hospitals and unfortunately Vietnam does poorly when it comes to doing and encouraging scientific research. [Vietnam fails to pay salaries to professors based on academic output and Vietnamese students aren&#039;t taught by the researchers either. Vietnam fails to convince many researchers who go abroad to come back, partly to the poor environment for scientific research.] A good research hospital will have the state-of-the-art when it comes to diseases they specialize in. Sometimes they may be the only place in the world with knowledge and treatment for rare diseases, and sometimes that could all be in the hands and head of one doctor.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Surprisingly, Taiwan beats Japan. And Thailand beats Singapore. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
So the Philippines has a good (low) score for their top hospital although a very poor score for their top 10 average. The Philippines seems attractive due to its best hospital being an eye hospital which probably conducts medical research on illnesses of the eye that has been published. Except for eye surgery, expats there might generally still fly abroad for significant medical treatment, Hong Kong or Bangkok.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This type of anomoly also affects Hong Kong. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Cambodia only has two listed hospitals so it&#039;s not possible to calculate an average top 5 or 10. From the rankings one could predict the inflow of many Cambodians traveling to Vietnam for medical treatment, or flying to Thailand. This appears to be the situation. FV Hospital in District 7 has staff that can speak Khmer in order to service Cambodian medical tourists. The order of magnitude difference between Singapore and Vietnam is akin to that between Vietnam and Cambodia.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The one hospital in Myanmar is one of the worst in the world. Remember, there were only 17000 hospitals listed. One can only hope with the recent opening up of Myanmar that we&#039;ll see some hospital services to support an increasingly demanding expat population.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;fieldset class=&quot;collapsible collapsed&quot;&gt;&lt;legend&gt;How did I calculate these numbers? (click to expand)&lt;/legend&gt;
&lt;code&gt;var x=0;$(&#039;tr.nav6a td:first-child&#039;).slice(0,10).each(function(){x += parseInt($(this).html())});console.log(x/10);var x=0;$(&#039;tr.nav6a td:first-child&#039;).slice(0,5).each(function(){x += parseInt($(this).html())});console.log(x/5)&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&#039;s easy to see for yourself that Australia ranks around Thailand and Singapore.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/fieldset&gt;

&lt;p&gt; 
The following is a Wikipedia list of wiki pages for hospitals all over Vietnam. It&#039;s not a complete listing, but it may be useful especially if you are traveling to smaller towns. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_hospitals_in_Vietnam&quot;&gt;List_of_hospitals_in_Vietnam&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Recently, I discovered first hand what a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.saigonist.com/b/night-emergency-room-vietnamese-hospital&quot;&gt;Vietnamese emergency room&lt;/a&gt; is like.
&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Internet Censorship in Southeast Asian Countries (Myanmar, China, Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam)</title>
    <link>http://www.saigonist.com/b/internet-censorship-southeast-asian-countries-myanmar-china-malaysia-thailand-cambodia-vietnam</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Vietnam has been labeled an &quot;enemy of the Internet&quot; by Reporters Without Borders. There have been a lot of cases of bloggers being targeted, harrassed, and arrested. But RSF (Reporters Sans Frontieres - French for Reporters Without Borders) are possibly speculating heavily on many of their other arguments such as banning Internet (gaming) cafes near schools, the real origins of DDoS attacks, Considering Internet penetration in this rather populous country, with Internet usage continuing to rise rapidly each year, and an explosion of Vietnamese businesses operating on the web, it might be a bit of hyperbole to say that Vietnam and the Internet are enemies, just like people mistakenly still think that Vietnam and America are still enemies. But censorship of websites is an issue here in Vietnam. It&#039;s an issue in all of Vietnam&#039;s neighbors in Southeast Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, to the north of Vietnam lies the vast Middle Kingdom of China (China isn&#039;t properly part of Southeast Asia but it does border many Southeast Asian countries). China has been labeled #1 Enemy of the Internet for implementing a technologically advanced firewall (the Great Firewall of China). In China, hundreds of popular American websites are blocked including Google, YouTube, Facebok and Twitter. Search queries are also monitored for keywords and then stopped if a person is searching about a sensitive topic like the Tiananmen Square massacre. Chinese are forced to use local versions of social media (like Sino Weibo) which are more easily controlled by the Chinese government. You could try to draw parallels to Facebook versus Zing Me and other social networks in Vietnam but the huge difference is that Facebook is still accessible and the one and only social media platform in Vietnam. TOR (The Onion Router, used for anonymously browsing the Internet and TOR .onion sites) is also blocked in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Malaysia isn&#039;t your typical enemy of the Internet. Its government (like Vietnam) encourages a digital (&quot;multimedia&quot;, a term from the 1990s) economy with various initiatives like Cyberjaya and the Multimedia Super Corridor and when those initiatives started, just as the Internet was blowing up around the world, the government declared that the Internet was to remain free and uncensored. But Convervative Muslims in charge do want to limit certain cultural shortcomings by censoring scenes in movies with nudity or even just cleavage and sex or even just kissing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Singapore - the country where chewing gum is banned and could get you caned. It&#039;s also a country with a rather long blacklist of blocked websites, mostly porn sites like YouPorn or Pussy.com. In Vietnam, pornography is illegal and you won&#039;t find Playboy or other girly mags being sold at magazine stands. But online, while ostensibly the Internet censorship laws are for blocking online porn, no porn sites are actually blocked (I&#039;ve checked some of them - for research purposes). In Singapore, to a lesser extent, bloggers have been shut down and so has a random website about traveling while infected with HIV due to unfavorable portrayal of Singapore&#039;s policies towards HIV carriers. But no reports of bloggers being jailed unless they were also jaywalking, chewing gum, dancing in public places without a proper permit, bringing durian onto busses, or being a graffiti artist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thailand demonstrates a tactic that has been used in Vietnam, Cambodia, and probably many countries. Websites are not strictly speaking made illegal by the government. Rather, the government makes secret requests to ISPs to make certain websites unavailable. ISPs can decide to comply or ignore the request but ignoring the request comes at a high cost and so ISPs will generally block any website upon request. This means now over 100,000 websites are blocked in Thailand, putting it in the same league as China! Out of the rest of the countries in the region Thailand and Cambodia are the only kingdoms. Thailand has lese majeste laws making it illegal to insult the monarchy. This has led to arrests of people saying potentially offensive things about the king on social media sites like Facebook or even for liking or retweeting such statements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cambodia follows Thailand and Vietnam&#039;s leads when it comes to Internet censorship (Cambodia also gets their Internet connection from those two countries). When the government &quot;requests&quot; that certain websites are blocked the ISPs generally comply making it unnecessary to outright criminalize the websites in Cambodia. At the same time, governments deny censoring any websites and ISPs also release confusing messages regarding any block or whether it&#039;s an official block or just &quot;technical difficulties&quot;. Like in Vietnam, certain blogs hosted by massive blogging platforms like Blogger and Bloghost have caused both entire platforms to be blocked by ISPs, not just the offending blogs. A certain controversial artists has had his website blocked, as has the NGO Global Witness, who fights againgst natural resource exploitation, corruption, and human rights abuses, probably for writing stuff like Cambodia should not stand for UN Security Council until land grabs and repression stop. Strangely, the prime minister of Cambodia briefly banned smartphones and 3G due to the potential of being able to view sexy streaming videos on one&#039;s mobile phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Burma, the problem isn&#039;t just that some websites are blocked. Rather, all websites are slow and access can be unbearably limited to the point where they are functionally blocked. In general, Internet access is hard to subscribe to and then expensive to use, unaffordable for most Burmese.  They also apparently have the same networking gear used for censorship as in China. With recent changes in attitudes towards the West and to media, with promises of no longer censoring newspapers, this is one country to watch in the future from any angle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laos, on the other hand, appears to not censor anything on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Using 3G Internet in Cambodia</title>
    <link>http://www.saigonist.com/b/using-3g-internet-cambodia</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;On my most recent trip to Cambodia I bought a Cambodian SIM card so that I could both make calls and use the Internet on my smartphone. At the Moc Bai/Bavet border are a number of Khmer people (who speak Vietnamese) hanging around offering to change money into Cambodian Riel from Vietnam Dong (or US dollars). They also sell sim cards for around 60k VND ($3) which gives you a few dollars worth of calls. They can also cut the SIMs into microsims for iPhones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got a MetFone sim but my Vietnamese Mobifone sim actually worked while in Bavet and didn&#039;t lose signal until we were a few kilometers from the border. When I eventually lost signal and switched in the new MetFone sim, however, I wasn&#039;t able to get on the internet with either GPRS or 3G. And even when I arrived in Phnom Penh I couldn&#039;t find anyone who knew how to activate 3G and MetFone&#039;s website was not accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the instructions for anyone who wants to activate 3G on their MetFone sim card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) Send &quot;3G ON&quot; or just &quot;ON&quot; as a sms to the number 133. This enables 3G for your account. But you still need to set up your phone to use their APN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) You can have MetFone configure your smartphone by sending a special configuration file but you need to know the name of your handset according to MetFone. You can guess it but if you guess wrong you won&#039;t receive anything or you&#039;ll receive a configuration file for the wrong phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Send &quot;MI &quot; to the number 111. For a Sony Ericsson P900 the handset code is P900. For an LG Optimus Black the code is P970. It is the code name your manufacturer uses for your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) If you can&#039;t figure out the right handset code or MetFone doesn&#039;t know about your phone then you can configure it manually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go into your connection settings and set up an APN.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
           Input information APN: Metfone&lt;br /&gt;
           Username:        Metfone&lt;br /&gt;
           Password:        No&lt;br /&gt;
           Input code 1111 ( if handset request) and reset again.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;0) When you need to check your balance to see how many phone credits or how many kilobytes of data you can transfer, dial the code &quot;*097#&quot;. This will send a command to your carrier and you&#039;ll get a message back immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may also need to reset your phone after enabling 3G or setting up your APN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that 3G coverage in Cambodia is very spotty compared to Vietnam (even though MetFone is from Vietnamese military company Viettel). Speed can be decent but you may lose connection even without moving. This applies to Phnom Penh. Like Vietnam, most hotels have free wifi although many cheap guesthouses don&#039;t. When looking around for hotels in Phnom Penh be sure to ask first. My tips for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.saigonist.com/b/how-find-hotel-vietnam-and-save-money&quot;&gt;finding a hotel in Vietnam&lt;/a&gt; also applies to Cambodia.&lt;/p&gt;

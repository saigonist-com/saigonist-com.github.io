    <title>Saigon Street Food - A Virtual Culinary Tour</title>
    <link>http://www.saigonist.com/vietnam/hcmc/saigon-street-food-virtual-culinary-tour</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Let&#039;s set some ground rules: Street food must be eaten on the sidewalk without the option of eating indoors, as many &quot;proper&quot; restaurants also have outdoor seating, even though such &quot;al fresco&quot; appropriations of the street are actually illegal and subject to periodic police inspections where illegally placed plastic chairs and tables are confiscated. For Vietnamese small business owners who don&#039;t even rent space inside any buildings, their whole business depends on police not cracking down on them. Perhaps a better solution would be a non-corrupt (haha) registration and hygiene inspection process for street food vendors, then the government could get some tax income, the business owners would have some stability, and the consumers would get some level of food safety. But for now, let&#039;s get back to reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. &lt;strong&gt;Banh Xeo&lt;/strong&gt; - often translated as Vietnamese pancakes or Vietnamese crepes. Like pancakes or crepes, a batter is poured into a circular pan to crispen a thin round layer of this &quot;cake&quot; which has toppings like shrimp and pork, bean sprouts, and sometimes mushrooms (but not so much in the street). Banh Xeo Mien Trung is a smaller version. You can try this on Phan Ke Binh Street (near DeciBel) and Ung Van Khiem Street near D2 in Binh Thanh District.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. &lt;strong&gt;Banh Mi Thit&lt;/strong&gt; - the Vietnamese submarine sandwich / roll. Next to pho, this is probably the most famous Vietnamese dish outside of Vietnam. A French bread roll spread with pate (both foods from the French colonial era) stuffed with some kind of meat, julienned carrots and pickled daikon, cilantro - and some fresh and extremely spicy chili peppers if you don&#039;t remember to ask them &quot;khong ot&quot;. Vo Van Tan near Cach Mang Thang 8 in District 3 has a popular shop to get some takeaway banh mi thit. Also try Banh Mi Heo Quay, pork with delicious -crispy- fat and skin attached, available on Ngo Tat To Street in Binh Thanh District.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. &lt;strong&gt;Mi Hoanh Thanh&lt;/strong&gt; - Chinese Won Ton Ramen Noodle Cart. Also seemingly referred to as &quot;van than&quot; in the North Vietnamese dialect. &quot;Mi&quot; refers to ramen noodles and if you think ramen means cheap instant noodles then you need to get schooled. Often these will be served in fancy wooden noodle carts which you can also sit at. The noodles should be fresh, not instant industrially dried noodles. Hoanh Thanh are won ton noodle dumplings. Also try Mi Xa Xiu - &quot;char siu&quot; in Chinese or cha-shu in Japanese. Try it at the corner of Xo Viet Nghe Tinh right after the Thi Nghe Bridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. &lt;strong&gt;Banh Khot&lt;/strong&gt; - Banh Khot is similar to Banh Xeo but thicker with a much smaller diameter. Too similar for me to distinguish is another dish called Banh Canh, not to be confused with the similarly pronounced Banh Canh noodle dish. Like Banh Xeo, after the batter and toppings are fired in their clay vessels they are wrapped by your hands in lettuce or mustard greens and rice paper, topped with fresh herbs, and then dipped in fish sauce. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. &lt;strong&gt;Hu Tiu (Nam Vang), Hu Tiu Go&lt;/strong&gt; - Hu Tiu (or Hu Tieu) is a kind of noodle. Hu Tiu Nam Vang refers to a version of this noodle dish, which can be eaten in soup or &quot;dry&quot;, which should be Khmer - Nam Vang is an old Vietnamese word for Phnom Penh. Hu Tiu Go isn&#039;t a flavor of Hu Tiu. Rather it refers to the way it is sold. Go means to knock, and a seller of Hu Tiu Go will push his cart down the street while knocking on wood to let people know he&#039;s coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6. &lt;strong&gt;Banh Trang Tron&lt;/strong&gt; - A favorite after school snack of Vietnamese girls. A trail mix of rice paper, herbs, chili chopped up and mixed with dried beef or quail eggs and served in a plastic bag with two small sticks to be used like chopsticks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7. &lt;strong&gt;Com Tam&lt;/strong&gt; - broken rice, a traditional South Vietnamese breakfast as opposed to pho in the North. Using the broken grains of rice served with BBQ pork (suon), sunny-side up egg (op-la), (bi), (cha), and with fish sauce (nuoc mam) dripped over to taste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8. &lt;strong&gt;Xoi&lt;/strong&gt; - Sticky rice. Can be served with separated chicken as easily as with ripe mango or other sweets. A favorite of mine is Xoi Khuc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9. &lt;strong&gt;Bot Chien&lt;/strong&gt; - What look like mochi cubes are thrown in a wok and fried with an egg or two into an omelette with fried cubes of... what exactly? Photo attached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10. &lt;strong&gt;Banh Cuon&lt;/strong&gt; - Kind of like a giant round noodle. Banh in Vietnamese can mean many things although it&#039;s often translated to cake. It can also mean bread and sometimes the noodle in a noodle dish. Banh Cuon is some kind of batter steamed in a giant circle until it&#039;s hard and noodley then topped with something like ground beef (or seafood or chicke and mushrooms if you want to get fancy). Then you add some &quot;cha&quot;, herbs, and bean sprouts and pour on the nuoc mam and put it all into your mouth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11. &lt;strong&gt;Bo La Lot&lt;/strong&gt; - This one almost killed me. Street food is all fun and games until you are vomiting out both ends of your body for 24 hours. This dish of mystery beef wrapped in &quot;lot&quot; leaves and then cooked over coals, then wrapped in rice paper or greens and topped with thinly sliced papaya or unripe bananas and other leaves, can be quite tasty. But take it from me: avoid buying it from the sidewalk sellers on Ton Duc Thang Street right at the beginning of Le Thanh Ton Street.&lt;br /&gt;
Drink&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Refreshments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nuoc Mia&lt;/strong&gt; - The quintessential street drink. Sugar cane juice made by running sticks of sugar cane through a press. When I first started drinking this it was availale for 2000 VND/glass but now it&#039;s no less than 4000 VND, which still comes out to less than 20 cents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sinh To&lt;/strong&gt; - fruit smoothies. Strawberry, tomato, avacado, custard apple, banana, mango, etc. Go to the Hang Xanh Roundabout (aka The Circle of Death) after midnight if you&#039;re bored and thirsty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trai Dua&lt;/strong&gt; - This is not even street food, it&#039;s jungle food. In the Mekong Delta, in provinces like Ben Tre, this magical fruit literally grows on trees. Coconuts can be drunk anywhere as long as you have a way to crack them open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tra Chanh&lt;/strong&gt; - This is a street drink but it&#039;s not a Saigon street drink. Next time I will write about drinking this lemon tea on the streets of Hanoi.&lt;/p&gt;

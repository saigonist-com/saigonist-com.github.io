    <title>Vung Tau Travel Basics - From Ho Chi Minh City</title>
    <link>http://www.saigonist.com/vietnam/travel/vung-tau-travel-basics-ho-chi-minh-city</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Any important city on the planet exists either because it was a port on the sea or was at a strategic point on a river. Few historic cities exist in the middle of deserts or forests not near any major water sources. Saigon is a river town not a seaside town. It lies near the mouth of the mighty Mekong River, but still some distance from the ocean. But for most of history, being on a strategic trade route was more important to a city&#039;s growth than being by a nice beach. Most cities worldwide therefore aren&#039;t built around beach resorts nor was being a scenic beach a big economic draw until recent decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, from time to time, when the residents of Ho Chi Minh City want to get away to the beach the closest option for them would be Vung Tau, a small seaside town that was also a popular R&amp;amp;R destination for American troops stationed in Saigon during the Vietnam War. It has changed a lot since then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting from Saigon to Vung Tau&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From downtown Saigon, one can take a water taxi/hydrofoil to central Vung Tau City in just 90 minutes or less.&lt;/p&gt;

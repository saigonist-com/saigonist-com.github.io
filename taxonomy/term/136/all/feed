    <title>Start your startup in Kansas City, or Vietnam</title>
    <link>http://www.saigonist.com/vietnam/hcmc/start-your-startup-kansas-city-or-vietnam</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Boulder&#039;s big VC investor dude Brad Feld has a house in Kansas City now. He doesn&#039;t live there, even for just part of the year, but he owns it. He&#039;s letting YOU live there. For free. FREE!!!  But should you live in Kansas City (a mid-sized town in the American southwest midwestern state of Missouri) to bootstrap your startup? If the rent is free?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Awhile back I talked about bootstrapping your startup in Ho Chi Minh City on the cheap. And what&#039;s better than cheap besides free?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Working in Ho Chi Minh City (or any city in Southeast Asia)</title>
    <link>http://www.saigonist.com/b/working-ho-chi-minh-city-or-any-city-southeast-asia</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week I was interviewed by Sketch Magazine, a monthly publication for Vietnam&amp;#39;s Japanese community. &amp;nbsp;So the September issue will feature a little something of my thoughts on living in Vietnam from a foreigner or Viet &lt;span data-scayt_word=&quot;Kieu&quot; data-scaytid=&quot;1&quot;&gt;Kieu&lt;/span&gt; perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One question that came up was: How did I end up in Vietnam? And why?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a question that&amp;#39;s pretty commonly asked in the &lt;span data-scayt_word=&quot;expat&quot; data-scaytid=&quot;2&quot;&gt;expat&lt;/span&gt; community. &amp;nbsp;Nobody chooses where they were born but we &lt;span data-scayt_word=&quot;expats&quot; data-scaytid=&quot;3&quot;&gt;expats&lt;/span&gt; all had some say in the foreign country we moved to. &amp;nbsp;I traveled around North America, Europe, Asia, and some of Latin America before deciding I wanted to live somewhere in Southeast Asia, finally settling on Ho Chi Minh City. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I ask others how they ended up here I get a variety of answers. &amp;nbsp;You could split them into &amp;quot;planned&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;accidently&amp;quot;. &amp;nbsp;Those who ended up here accidently stayed because of:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;a girl (often now an ex-)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;came on holiday and became addicted to cheap beer&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;came for school and decided to stay (a lot of Germans, Koreans, and Australians)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others come here due to Vietnamese blood relations, and some come specifically for the business opportunities. &amp;nbsp;And then there are the true &lt;span data-scayt_word=&quot;expats&quot; data-scaytid=&quot;4&quot;&gt;expats&lt;/span&gt;, the ones who were sent here or came to work for a specific job. &amp;nbsp;Traditionally, they would get a fat &lt;span data-scayt_word=&quot;expat&quot; data-scaytid=&quot;5&quot;&gt;expat&lt;/span&gt; compensation package with housing allowances (thus driving up housing costs for all) and other perks, but this is changing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what do those &lt;span data-scayt_word=&quot;expats&quot; data-scaytid=&quot;6&quot;&gt;expats&lt;/span&gt; who didn&amp;#39;t come here with a job in hand already do?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Freelance. &amp;nbsp;With Vietnam connected to the world via internet (barely, sometimes), many of us with creative skills such as programming or writing can continue to work for clients back home. &amp;nbsp;Due to the much lower cost of living compared to Western countries, one doesn&amp;#39;t need to work as many hours or maintain as many clients as before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Find a job. &amp;nbsp;This is a bit harder since there may not be the breadth of positions available to match your specific work experience. &amp;nbsp;Having a PhD in some applied science may be worthless here. &amp;nbsp;Nobody may have heard of the university you thought was famous. &amp;nbsp;But most people I know eventually get a real job here (ignoring survivorship bias).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Make your own job. &amp;nbsp;This could be by starting a company, something which is within the reach of most foreigners here, whereas it would have been a highly risky use of savings back home. &amp;nbsp;Others shop their &lt;span data-scayt_word=&quot;skillset&quot; data-scaytid=&quot;10&quot;&gt;skillset&lt;/span&gt; around to companies who might not have had a position open if you can make them realize you are the solution they just weren&amp;#39;t looking for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Teach English. &amp;nbsp;This is what people do while they are in the process of #2 or #3. &amp;nbsp;Some people do this for years. &amp;nbsp;Teaching English in Vietnam is the easiest way to make decent money in Vietnam, assuming you&amp;#39;re from the US, the UK, Canada, or Australia/New Zealand (but they also hire good English speakers from the Philippines, Europe, and other countries). &amp;nbsp;Teachers are in high demand and salaries are often more than you&amp;#39;d make back home. &amp;nbsp;Teachers don&amp;#39;t even need high school degrees, much less college degrees. &amp;nbsp;Some English teachers find a school before coming here, but it&amp;#39;s absolutely not necessary. &amp;nbsp;The situation is similar in neighboring countries like Cambodia and Thailand. &amp;nbsp;But with low cost of living and high salaries, Vietnam is probably one of the best countries to come and teach English in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That covers the where, the what, and the why. &amp;nbsp;But how? &amp;nbsp;It used to be quite easy for most Westerners to stay in Vietnam on a 6-month business visa without actually having any business here. &amp;nbsp;They&amp;#39;ve since cracked down a bit but it&amp;#39;s still possible and quite common to stay on a 3-month tourist visa renewed multiple times. &amp;nbsp;The laws on the book (not so much in practice) are always changing though, so more on that next time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

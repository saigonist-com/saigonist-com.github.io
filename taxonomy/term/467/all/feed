    <title>A Foreigner in Vietnam During Tet</title>
    <link>http://www.saigonist.com/vietnam/hcmc/foreigner-vietnam-during-tet</link>
    <description>&lt;h2&gt;A Quiet American in a Quiet Vietnam&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About two weeks after I first arrived in Saigon, it began: Tet. What a horrible mistake, being in Vietnam right at that time! Tet, being the single Vietnamese holiday that is equivalent to &lt;strong&gt;Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year&lt;/strong&gt; in one long week that often stretches to a month for many students as well as laborours. While pre-Tet is a time of high commercial activity, it all comes to a full stop at midnight of the Lunar New Year. Vietnamese people go home. And for Saigon&#039;s 10 million or so population, this mostly means going back to places far from metropolitan Ho Chi Minh City. Vietnamese cities are full of economic migrants, young people coming as students or looking for jobs so they can earn money to send home. And Tet is the time of the year, for most economic migrants it&#039;s the one and only time of the year, when they return home to their families. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a company or factory, you don&#039;t expect anyone to work during the days of Tet. It doesn&#039;t matter if you&#039;re a foreign company with orders from foreign countries that need to be filled, by customers that neither know nor care that a &quot;Tet&quot; is happening. If you&#039;re lucky, your employees will come back to work after a week, after you&#039;ve paid them a &lt;strong&gt;&quot;13th month&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; Tet bonus, often equivalent to one month&#039;s salary.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Learning Spanish in Ho Chi Minh City</title>
    <link>http://www.saigonist.com/vietnam/learning-spanish-ho-chi-minh-city</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ve had several friends ask me where they can learn Spanish in Ho Chi Minh City, especially since the University of Social Sciences and Humanities canceled their Spanish language course. There aren&#039;t that many people who want to learn or speak Spanish in Vietnam since there is less trade between Vietnam and Spanish-speaking countries (compared to Japanese, Korean, Chinese) but it&#039;s a hobby for some.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My friend let me know about an open course at her Spanish school:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The school is called Jaleo (Escuela de Espanol) in Phu Nhuan district at 38 Hoa Su Street, Ward 12, Phu Nhuan - near Phan Xich Long street. Telephone: 08 3517 1288 or you can call 01649922169.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have a basic class starting September 5th on Mondays and Wednesdays from 6:30-8:00PM. The 8 week course is 2.4 million. Other courses are listed on their website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The teachers are native Spanish speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides Spanish language they also have courses on Spanish/Latin American culture and also do private tutoring. Basically, it&#039;s a small operation from people who want to make Spanish teaching possible in Vietnam, not a big corporate language center. Open to both Vietnamese and expats.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Software Outsourcing to Vietnam: A Major Challenge</title>
    <link>http://www.saigonist.com/b/software-outsourcing-vietnam-major-challenge</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;This post comes out of a conversation I had with my friend Prithvi, who has years of experience in the outsourcing industry both here and in China and other countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outsourcing is a huge industry here in Vietnam.  It solves several problems for Vietnam.  First, it brings in much needed income.  Second, it does so without requiring a high ratio of expensive imported inputs (compare this to making shoes which are exported for a cheap price, but most of the costs come from materials which must be imported).  Third, it helps advance domestic use of technology, which should make all industries more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;

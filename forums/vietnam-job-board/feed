Furthermore, to increase efficiency through financial practices, lean systems and standardized process tools, enabling companies to gain more control over their organization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, having a broad exposure in different industries, has in turn given me a large skill base that I can apply over cross-functional industries and roles&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Formally, I have an academic background in electrical engineering, mathematics and science, which I have used to specialize my performance in quantifying and analyzing business and manufacturing operations with statistical and technological techniques. Furthermore, having a science background has also been beneficial in understanding the complexities of various industries, and efficiently being able to standardize and improve many management approaches in them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, I also have an academic background in international business and a number of certificates in quality management, lean management, business processes, operations management and project management.&lt;/p&gt;

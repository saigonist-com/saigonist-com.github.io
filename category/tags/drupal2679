  <div class="content">
    
    <p>Recently I attended a BarCamp where there was a session about <strong>monetizing blogs</strong> for a very modest monthly income, although an amount that amounts to a lot for a local blogger. With Drupal, setting up Google AdSense content is easy. </p>
<p>First, just copy the code generated from Adsense into a new block using the block admin interface. Be sure to save the node with the PHP Input Filter (you may need to give yourself permission in admin/permissions to use this powerful filter). Full HTML filter is <strong>not sufficient</strong> for AdSense code as it will break the finicky JavaScript, so use PHP which performs no filtering or transformations or <strong>create a new input filter</strong> that does no filtering.</p>
<p>You may want to create a special <strong>region</strong> (by editing the .info file for your theme and adding a new line, then refreshing cache to see it in the dropdown in blocks admin) for your ads otherwise use an existing region to place the block. If you already have regions like a sidebar that has space for content in the same dimensions (especially width) as your chosen AdSense ad then you won't need to do anything. If you want to optimize your ads though it's recommended, even by Google themselves, to choose larger ad sizes - especially <strong>large square ads</strong>.</p>
<p>For placing the node somewhere within the node's content, it's trickier as you can't place it use the block admin interface which only deals with regions that are defined in .info and made available via preprocess functions to your page.tpl.php. You can still use blocks to contain the code though. So create a new block, then look for the number in the URL which is the block id. Then you can manually place that block's content anywhere with this code:</p>
<p><div class="geshifilter"><pre class="javascript geshifilter-javascript" style="font-family:monospace;">$block <span style="color: #339933;">=</span> module_invoke<span style="color: #009900;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #3366CC;">'block'</span><span style="color: #339933;">,</span> <span style="color: #3366CC;">'block'</span><span style="color: #339933;">,</span> <span style="color: #3366CC;">'view'</span><span style="color: #339933;">,</span> <span style="color: #339933;">&lt;</span>BLOCK_ID_HERE<span style="color: #339933;">&gt;</span><span style="color: #009900;">&#41;</span><span style="color: #339933;">;</span>
print $block<span style="color: #009900;">&#91;</span><span style="color: #3366CC;">'content'</span><span style="color: #009900;">&#93;</span><span style="color: #339933;">;</span></pre></div></p>
<p>When publishing your ad blocks, if they don't appear at first and you see <strong>"Bad Request 400"</strong> in Chrome's Developer JavaScript Console, you can try waiting and may magically go away after awhile. That's what happened to me.</p>
<p>There's also an AdSense module (http://drupal.org/project/adsense) which makes this all a bit easier, but as you can see it's not hard at all to do manually, which means one less module on your system to complicate things.</p>
<p>But here are some other things the Drupal AdSense module can do:</p>
<p><cite><br />
The module provides easy-to-use ad blocks.<br />
You can easily disable the ads for certain roles.<br />
Provides simple controls for troubleshooting the ads before going live with the site.<br />
If Google changes some minor details in the script in , your script can be updated site-wide just by upgrading the module.<br />
If you want to do ad revenue sharing, there's really no other option<br />
</cite></p>
<p>This technique can be used for other online advertising networks besides Google AdSense. It could just as easily be used for Amazon.com's affiliate program. If you're in Vietnam you might consider one of the burgeoning number of Vietnamese online ad networks, although they won't have anything like the inventory of Google.</p>

    <p>How can we store tables or spreadsheets in Drupal content nodes?</p>
<p>Drupal is a Content Management System as well as a <strong>Content Management Framework</strong>. It's meant for facilitating the creation and editing of content, where content doesn't just mean simple text. CCK allows Drupal site managers to easily enable complex data types for their content. But sometimes it's not so easy to manage lots of simple data in the way that a spreadsheet (meaning Excel or Google Spreadsheet) easily manages many rows and columns of related data.</p>
<p>Sometimes you really want <strong>tabular data</strong> and you may not know for sure how many rows or columns you'll want beforehand, which is never a problem for Excel or Google Spreadsheet (which is also why sometimes people abuse Excel as a general purpose database). Maybe you are importing spreadsheets or are using spreadsheets with many rows and columns, and only want to use a section of the spreadsheet. Maybe you need to use spreadsheets because you are using formulas and want to do some graphing based on some numbers too. In fact, Excel can do much more. Rather than hoping all of those use cases will make it into a Drupal module anytime soon, wouldn't it be nice if you could just <strong>embed a spreadsheet in a node</strong>?</p>
<p>There are some <a href="../../tech/drupal/attaching-tablematrixarray-drupal-node.html">modules for attaching tables or tabular data to nodes</a>  but in the end the interface can be a bit unwieldy.  I discussed building something like a spreadsheet to quickly edit many values and below I present a <strong>demonstration</strong>.</p>
<p>What is already available that we could use to attach spreadsheets or something similar to nodes?</p>
<p>1. You could: Configure a Google spreadsheet that's either public or somehow accessed via a Google api, perhaps using OAuth2 or just assuming the viewer also has edit access to the spreadsheet. Google already lets you embed spreadsheets including the editable spreadsheet but they don't let you limit the view of the spreadsheet (limiting the view still lets everyone access the whole spreadsheet by changing the URL). </p>
<p>We would also need new nodes to automatically create sheets in the spreadsheet or new spreadsheets altogether and embed them in node edit. This would need to use their APIs since the embeddable Google Spreadsheets require an existing spreadsheet, otherwise this step needs to be done manually for each node - a new Google spreadsheet created per node.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://github.com/evolvingweb/redmine_google_docs">Redmine Google Docs plugin</a> takes a similar approach and shows how the resulting data could be embedded.</p>
<p>(This <a href="http://www.mediawikiwidgets.org/Google_Spreadsheet"MediaWiki Google Spreadsheet widget</a> might be worth investigating as well.)</a></p>
<p>2. Another approach would be to take an existing JavaScript or Java spreadsheet that could be embedded. This could be exactly what you want if you need the full functionality of Excel in each node. One such online spreadsheet is <a href="http://code.google.com/p/zkspreadsheet/">ZK Spreadsheet</a> which is written in Java, and would let you have full formula and charting support.</p>
<p>3. Embed a widget like the form below as a CCK field in a node. It would be a new CCK field type where the editing widget is the below spreadsheet-like table and the display widget might be the same thing, an uneditable table, or the raw JSON string representation. In the database, the actual value of the field would be JSON (unless you wanted to use PHP's serialize() which would require POSTing values first instead of just posting the json value). This means you wouldn't relate or compare this field to anything else, as with any serialized data in a database. You could come up with some other schema involving columns and rows to store the table's values for each field in a node but I'm not sure it's worthwhile.</p>
<p>I created this demonstration but haven't turned it into a Drupal module. There is code to dump the edited values into a single JSON value to be stored in the database but the storage would be module-specific. </p>

    <p>The problem is this. ImageCache is a great simple way to transform random images into useful dimensions, etc. But sometimes the uploaded image is already exactly the quality and even dimensions we want. But after imagecache module runs, the file size is actually larger than the original while the quality has gone down, despite JPG image quality being 100% (default is set to 75%). One workaround can be to re-sharpen the image (imagecache_sharpen) but this also loses some quality.</p>
<p>1. Check that the uploaded image (metadata saved as CCK field, file stored directly in sites/default/files) has not been degraded in quality.</p>
<p>2. Check that minimum/maximum resolution for the image fields (CCK) are set to 0 (no restriction) so that they aren't accidentally resized at the upload to CCK step.</p>
<p>3. Run "drush imagecache-flush" in case you have files left over from a recent imagecache configuration change.</p>
<p>4. Try replacing GD with ImageMagick. If you stick with GD, and try compiling a newer GD library. ImageMagick by default can output higher quality images than GD.</p>
<p>How does Drupal's image resizing and processing work?</p>
<p>ImageCache goes through imageapi which uses different image processing functions based on the library (by default GD and ImageMagick support are provided) used.</p>
<p>Any resizing operation will result in a change (loss) in quality. That is to be expected since upsizing creates new pixels from single original pixels without having new information (unlike the magical effects of zooming into images on CSI shows) and downsizing will generally cause information to be lost and many pixels will "store" the information from several surrounding pixels.</p>
<p>So only operations that keep the image the same dimensions or crop the image (in which case the cropped portion has the same dimensions in both old and new files) will retain the same quality and avoid any blurring.</p>
<p>When using PHP's GD, Drupal will make calls to imagecopyresampled which will affect image quality unless image width and height are kept the same or cropping is performed. This is partly due to imagecopyresampled and partly the way it is called. "Fastimagecopyresampled" is a possible replacement: (from http://us.php.net/manual/en/function.imagecopyresampled.php#77679) - this is a higher quality version of PHP's imagecopyresampled. It does result in higher quality but requires hacking Drupal code instead of overriding any hooks.</p>
<p>I've found that it's better to use ImageMagick than GD. The only remaining problem is that for similar quality images, the file size is something like twice as big after ImageMagick processing. You could mess around with ImageMagick's quality settings by hacking Image API code or by copying imageapi_imagemagick.module into a custom module and configuring it for use instead. But you risk breaking quality for other images. I haven't found the reason why IMagick makes image file sizes larger.</p>

    <p>Today I spent the day hacking on the WordPress site for BarCampSaigon. I'm no expert on WordPress but trying to hack a theme with it makes me appreciate Drupal so much more. WordPress does have an "API" or at least some documented functions which are used internally which can also be used by developers but it's certainly not designed with developers in mind. Wordpress is great for bloggers. Drupal is great for developers and users who need something more than a blog will have to choose between working with Drupal or fighting against WordPress. :-)</p>
<p>Due to two recent conferences, BarCamp Hanoi and the opening of DrupalVietnam.org, I put together a presentation called "The Business Case for Drupal in Vietnam".  I'll blog about those two events later.</p>
<p>I targeted two main groups: outsourcing companies based in Vietnam who want to attract more clients abroad, and any software development shop in Vietnam who is deciding what technology to use to develop websites. There is a third group, who are those companies with simpler website needs who perhaps only need one website and are not in the business of making websites.</p>
<p>I go over a number of common concerns that customers outside of Vietnam might have which Vietnamese companies might not expect. One point is being vendor agnostic when developing what is essentially a CMS. I make a strong point that one should never fall to the temptation of developing your own in-house CMS and as a consumer, you should stay far away from such "bespoke" solutions in the modern age where content management frameworks such as Drupal exist.  I also think Drupal represents a strong brand name that is not well-known yet in Vietnam, but we all know how much Vietnamese people love brands.</p>
<p>On the supply side, I talk about why Drupal is a decent choice for Vietnamese developers, similar to any web developer. But the main recent news is that there is finally Drupal training being made available in Vietnam, much like for Joomla, and that PHP is widely known in Vietnam not just because there are books on it in the Vietnamese language, and that there is now a core Drupal community in Vietnam represented by DrupalVietnam.org (which I somehow became vice president of).</p>
<p>In general, I say go with your strengths. If web development is not your strength, then hire someone proper to do it for you while you focus on your core business. If web development is your business, make better use of your developers by using a CMS. </p>
<p>Anyways, here's the presentation.</p>

    <p>Drupal's Views module has a lot of hooks that can be used to modify the behavior of a hook, from building the query to putting together the output.  Hooks are also used by modules which want to add to the Views building interface, even the basic node-based Views.</p>
<p>Views supports a number of hooks which aren't documented.  One I came across recently was hook_views_query_substitutions.  This is potentially a powerful hook, one which the module Views arguments in filters (currently a sandbox module only for developers) takes advantage of to allow filter value substitution from the Views UI.</p>
<p>Hook hook_views_query_substitutions is pretty basic.  By implementing the hook, you return an array of values you want to substitute with the keys you want to substitute for.  This is how the magic values like ***ADMINISTER_NODES*** which you see in the Views query preview get turned into valid SQL.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>function user_views_query_substitutions($view) {
  global $user;
  return array('***CURRENT_USER***' =&gt; intval($user-&gt;uid));
}
</pre><p>
After this hook is called, Views will then run str_replace with the keys of the substitutions array and its values and apply it to the breadcrumb, title, and views arguments, as well as the query string that has been built so far.</p>
<p>Hook hook_views_query_substitutions gets called in the execute() call of Views.  The first thing execute() does is build(), which you can hook into with hook_views_pre_build, hook_views_query_alter, and views_post_build (in that order), then you can hook into hook_views_pre_execute and hook_views_post_execute (the latter happens after the views query is executed and shows an unsubstituted query, there is no hook where one can see the substituted query).  You also have a chance to hook into the db_rewrite_sql call.</p>
<p>Module "Views arguments in filters" is pretty basic and only allows substitution in filters which allow you to enter open text (so that you can set a value like '%1').  But by doing something similar, we can use a string passed in as a Null argument to command a Drupal module to do even more, like string substitution on any part of the query. I have a module in development now that does exactly that.</p>

  <div class="content">
    
    <p>This past weekend was the third annual Saigon MobileDevCamp held at
Bach Khoa University.  Although I'm mainly a web developer, as the event was billed as
a brother to BarCamp, I decided to go and check it out, meet some
people, support my friend Dan, and see if anything from the event could be applied to
the upcoming BarCamp Saigon on December 11th.  
</p><p>
Like BarCamp, the venue is a local university. However, the quality of facilities between a regular Vietnamese university like Bach Khoa and a foreign-operated campus like RMIT are on a quite different level.  Most rooms were without air conditioning and became quite hotter than I'm accustomed to.
In the morning there were
a number of sessions on developing mobile apps (I checked out a session on PhoneGap but missed the Unity 3D session). In contrast to the BarCamp ideal, guest speakers were invited to give sessions which were planned and scheduled beforehand. Topics were confined to the "mobile development" theme.
</p><p>
After lunch, the main event would
be a 24-hour coding competition. As I was already waking up far earlier than usual to
attend the conference which I hadn't even properly registered for, I had no intention of joining the hackathon but
I would eventually be overcome by my friend Cong's excitement for Doing Things.
</p>
<fieldset class="collapsible collapsed"><legend>The Contest (click to expand)</legend>

<h2>19 teams. 5 persons max. 24 hours. 3 categories.</h2>
<p>
There were 19 teams of up to five people competing.  We were number
19, registering about an hour after the competition had begun.  (Not only was I the only foreigner on our team, I was the only foreigner on any team.  The rest of the foreigners were there to hang out and talk to people, which was all I originally intended on.) Participants included employees of sponsors as well as students.
</p><p>
</p><p>
At the start of the competition, MC Minh announced in Vietnamese 
the three categories that apps could be in: spelling, medical
emergencies, and fighting pollution. (I think I misunderstood initially, but later an email in English was sent out.)  This prevents teams from having ideas and apps already in development beforethe competition.  This, along with the 24 hour time limit and 5-man team limit, are the constraints we were working with; otherwise no judging criteria were announced.  It's unrealistic to expect to develop much of an application in 24 hours and we knew this going in. We would later realize how little the actual code mattered.
</p><p>
Once the 24 hour clock had started ticking at 2 PM and neither Cong nor I had joined any teams, we decided to see what we could come up between the two of us.  We went outside for some fresh air (actually, cigarette smoke) and discussed some ideas for the
spelling topic but we dismissed them the most quickly.  We came up with an idea
for the medical emergency category but when we came up with an idea
for the environmental category, one which we could talk about at length and come up with numerous uses for, that's when
    Cong
called up Hong who also liked the idea and joined our team as our third member. We were probably the smallest team there.
</p><p>
During the hacking event there is a large room available for
participants to use and even sleep in. At night there was a pizza party. For me, the room was too hot and
humid so we decided to leave and find someplace more conducive
to hacking for the remaining hours.  We even considered renting a hotel room for 300,000VND but in the end
we decided to just go to my house which at least has soft places to
lie down, a working (at least better than Bach Khoa's) wifi connection, and air conditioning.  The only
problem was that it was a bit far from the competition so we lost some
time commuting there and back. We also got soaked by rain on the way.
</p>

<h2>Hackathon</h2>
<p>
A hackathon is a chance for hackers to push themselves both mentally and physically. Although in previous years, teams who skipped sleeping at all didn't fare so well, I'm sure most people didn't get a good night's sleep.  For our team, besides a short nap, a dinner break as the rain was dying down, and a breakfast break for my teammates, we were hacking the entire time we were at my house. As the hours wore on, I found myself getting more easily frustrated while staring at nonfunctioning code, code that it would often later turn out didn't need to be written. In some ways, the experience is similar to working at a startup with even shorter horizons.  
</p>
</fieldset>

 <fieldset class="collapsible collapsed"><legend>Our Idea (click to expand)</legend>
<p>
Our idea with this: we live in an apathetic world where social
problems that were once taken care of by the local (think village) community are now left to a (criminally)
unresponsive government.  Littering,
driving dangerously, and domestic violence may be crimes which are
witnessed by millions of people every day who simply think "it's not my
business".  The saying goes, "No good deed goes unpunished".   Clearly, the world needs a hero.  But there are heroes all
around us or at least people doing heroic things. We just don't
recognize them as heroes.  In real life, there is no Superman. But suppose  
each of us is a Clark Kent, hiding an "inner Superman"?
</p><p>
We wanted to attack a problem that was beyond just our ability to solve. We wanted to create a better world, not just entertain. We wanted to think beyond the contest, while still participating within its constraints. We wanted to do well, but more importantly do good.
</p>
<h2>The Solution</h2>
<p>
Our solution was to create an application that makes it simple (in a way only possible with modern technoloy) to be
recognized and recognize others for doing simple deeds that might
otherwise be too mundane to mention (mundane being what most people's initial impression of Twitter's concept was), meaning also that it's "not worth
doing".  At first, we would be increasing awareness of the dismal situation
within and around each person, then encourage them to take small
actions to improve the situation with friends and strangers. There are still some good people left in the world; others are at least good enough to act altruistically if it's convenient enough. Not only would you receive recognition for your history of good deeds, we would arrange for local businesses to sponsor the top do-gooders on each district's leaderboard, giving them access to influential people (in a way that Klout is trying and failing to do). This would provide operating and marketing income as well as give people an extra push to participate.
</p>
<h2>
Some Use Cases
</h2>
<p>
You see a truck hit a bike.  Before the truck driver has a chance to get away you snap a quick photo of the truck's license plate, tag it as a crime-in-progress, and your photo and location are quickly uploaded. Now, anyone else using the app in the same neighborhood can spot the truck and force it to stop.
</p><p>
You see a pile of trash near a canal. You snap a photo and tag it "trash" and as you're clearing it up, a fellow user who lives nearby comes to help.  When you've cleaned up the area, you both snap shots of the results and receive thanks from each other and some latecomers.
</p><p>
You get stuck in traffic. Up ahead you see that several cars are in the wrong lane and are stuck in gridlock. You post a "traffic" update with location and a few people about to leave work, and a friend in a taxi approaching that intersection thank you.
</p><p>
You see a new crack in the road. You snap a photo of it and send the link, which includes the GPS coordinates, to the local authorities. After a few weeks, the crack hasn't been fixed and has grown wider.  Eventually, the post gathers "thanks" and comments from a number of people and someone is forced to take responsibility for the fact that action wasn't taken earlier.
</p><p>
You see your neighbor abuse his wife. What can you do? After publicly shaming him, you receive some helpful advice in the comments.
</p><p>
Your neighborhood has a small plot of unused dirt, so you plant a tree there.
</p><p>
There are also the good things others are doing. When you see someone who is not a police officer stand in the street and direct traffic. When a mother scolds a child for littering. When a stranger tells you your bag is unzipped, or your phone about to fall out of your pocket. The person who sticks a big block in a pothole. The person who stops a taxi from entering a crowded one-way street in the wrong direction. The person who subdues a drunken belligerent Australian when the police couldn't do it for two hours. The inspector who refuses a bribe. The seller who throws out dirty or spoiled food. The car that doesn't enter a backed up intersection and block it when the light turns red.
</p>
<h2>SoLoMo</h2>
<p>
The idea has all of today's buzz words. It's social, mobile, and local. It has crowdsourced goodness. It will post to your Facebook, Twitter, and Foursquare. It's green, social enterprise that profits from companies that want to greenwash. It's got gamification. It's a location-based service measuring real reputation online. It consumes web APIs like Google Maps, while exposing its own API for others to mashup.
</p>
</fieldset>

 <fieldset class="collapsible collapsed"><legend>Implementation (click to expand)</legend>
<h2>Drupal | REST | iOS | Your Social Networks</h2>
<p>
The mobile application stores and retrieves data from a website we developed for it.  I developed a
web backend and frontend using Drupal which exposes a REST API which was consumed by
the iPhone app which could use it to login, create and retrieve local status updates
with photo and location much like Facebook, Twitter, or Foursquare.  
Other people could then see what people were doing near them and
either thank them or leave a comment, or even go there in person and help -- it could be happening a hundred meters away.  By
posting updates and getting thanked you earn points which puts
you on the leaderboard for your local district and can lead to being awarded badges, like "trash hero".  The idea was we would
find local businesses to sponsor each district and give prizes to the
community leaders while getting to be associated as an upstanding member of a
neighborhood.
</p><p>
We integrated with Google maps to show location and also used their
reverse geo-code API to find the ward or district name, so people could "follow" a neighborhood irregardless of distance -- like their home.  Furthermore, there was a one-way "follow" relationship like Twitter and Google+ to get all of a local hero's updates. More followers leads to more thanks. 
</p><p>
The web version (same Drupal site as the API) has all the same functionality as the mobile app
and more. We developed an iPhone app for the contest, but an equivalent Android version would be easy to build. We used Twitter Bootstrap as a foundation for the frontend design.
</p><p>
In the future, we could strongly integrate with Facebook, Twitter, Foursquare, and any other social network which allows geo-tagging of posts, so their posts appear inline with your local hero timeline.
</p>
</fieldset>

 <fieldset class="collapsible collapsed"><legend>Presentation, judging, and lessons learned (click to expand)</legend>

<p>
All teams had to be physically present in the main room at 1PM on Sunday, which effectively meant we lost over an hour of hacking time. We arrived just in time for the deadline, but then waited another 4-5 hours to give our presentation and demo. We had probably slept less than 8 hours combined among the three of us, and by the time it was our turn to present, I was nearly completely faded. There's a lesson in that. 
</p>

<p>
<h2>Humans Get Worn Down By Serial Decision-Making</h2>
<p>
Our first lesson was this: don't present last. Don't expect judges not to be mentally exhausted after several hours of listening to presentations. Don't expect that their state of mind will be the same when they started as when they're about to finish.  
</p>

<h2>Don't Alienate The Judges</h2>
<p>
In short: Our presentation was a failure. It was a trainwreck that lasted 10 minutes. By the time we were presenting, a strict 10 minute time limit was being enforced. I think our presentation was designed for 20 minutes. Both Cong and Hong had experience with previous MobileDevCamps and they had made a presentation for the app before I had finished coding.
</p><p>
We opened with a video of a toddler in China being run over by a truck, a clip that sparked outrage all over the world including Vietnam and within China. It was bad form. My partner hadn't realized that two of the judges sitting in front of us were actually from China. They were visibly upset, not taking kindly to the implication, and this set the tone for the rest of the presentation. Meanwhile, other judges wanted to watch the video again. Not only did this upset the Chinese judges but the other sympathetic organizers were also quite upset by the possibility that we had jeapordized future sponsorship by the Chinese. By the time we were done talking about the video, we only had 5 minutes left, and hadn't even opened the app.  
</p>

<h2>Fake It.</h2>
<p>
In the remaining time, we struggled to explain the idea behind the product and finally give a quick demo of some of the features. We ran out of time before showing off some of the minor features.  One of the judges expressed interest in hearing about the implementation, and we missed a chance to impress based on technical features. There just wasn't any time.
</p>

</fieldset>


<p>
So that's it. We lost. We learned some lessons.
</p>
<p>1. Be one of the first to present if you can.</p>
<p>2. Don't single out and alienate judges.</p>
<p>3. Don't build clean, well-architected software with maintainable code. In real life, this matters. For this competition, it doesn't. </p>

<p>
The greatest tragedy perhaps (besides not winning) was that the presentations were all made in private with the judges.  Having groups present their apps for everyone to see, or at least putting them somewhere online, would have been the BarCamp way. As we didn't receive any feedback or anything from the judges, it would have been nice to share what we all worked on for 24 hours (multiplied by nearly 100 people) and be able to learn from others' experience.  Even if there wasn't time for all to present, I don't think I was the only one interested in seeing at least the demos from the winners.
</p>



<fieldset class="collapsible collapsed"><legend>P.S. Our second idea was this (click to expand)</legend>
<p>
In Vietnam, emergency response service is nearly nonexistent.  If you
get into an accident where you need emergency medical treatment you
will most likely die.  People are reluctant to take you to the
hospital because the hospital will then expect you to pay the bill.
Taxis don't want to deal with getting blood in their seats.  If nobody
contacts your relatives or if you don't have enough money in your
wallet to pay the hospital on arrival, people will just let you die because they don't feel it's their business.  See Idea #1.
</p><p>
Our idea was to make it so your friends and family could automatically
be contacted in case of emergency.  Many phones have a feature where
without unlocking the phone, the phone can still make emergency calls.
 But what if the phone could also send an SMS message and some friends
as well as post a call for help on your Facebook wall, your Twitter, your FourSquare, etc. along with your location.  It could turn out to be a follower on Twitter you don't follow back who happens to be nearby who saves your life. In Vietnam, this type of "hail Mary" is more likely to get a response than the local 911-like service.  Of course there are problems, like the fact most people wouldn't think to install the app until they're laying there dying, if that.

  <div class="content">
    
    <p>There are multiple modules for importing and exporting Drupal taxonomies (Drupal switches between using the term "taxonomy" and "vocabulary" like a clinical schizophrenic).  Some use CSV format (http://drupal.org/project/taxonomy_csv), others XML (http://drupal.org/project/taxonomy_xml), and still others use a PHP array (http://drupal.org/project/taxonomy_export).</p>
<p>Some of these modules use the same paths for the export and import pages but they are different modules and aren't compatible. If you have both Taxonomy Export and Taxonomy XML installed at the same time they will conflict.</p>
<p>Except for CSV, the other import/export modules need you to create documents in a rather wordy XML or PHP code format, which can actually be more work than entering the terms in manually. Some people may use taxonomy import/export for only the taxonomy definition rather than terms. It's sometimes unclear what happens if you want to re-import duplicate term names later. </p>
<p>What worked best for me was using Taxonomy Manager which gives you an improved UI for organizing terms within a vocabulary. I wish it made editing the core fields of a taxonomy more ajax-y but what it does provide is an easy way to add multiple terms at once, a textarea for pasting in a list of terms, and a way to select where the new terms will go. So you can paste in all the top level terms, then paste in all the 2nd level children of the 1st term and select the 1st term to indicate they will all go under it. As long as you don't have too many different branches, then this can be done fairly easily.</p>

    <p>[This blog post is a rewrite of just the main points due to my baby <span data-scayt_word="Macbook" data-scaytid="1">Macbook</span> Pro dying while I was distracted.]</p><p>Drupal content types with <span data-scayt_word="CCK" data-scaytid="2">CCK</span> make it quite easy to add any number of defined fields to an &#39;object&#39;, and with multiple/unlimited values for a field or with node references it&#39;s possible to make a Drupal node &#39;two-dimensional&#39;.</p><p>Sometimes you need more. Sometimes you want tabular data, a table, to be part of a node. If the table always has the same dimensions, and at least the same columns for each node, then the above can work through node references and views.</p><p>What if you want to add a different two-dimensional table to nodes of a content type, but without knowing the number or labels for the columns and rows beforehand. &nbsp;For example, you might want to attach a pricing table to a node, with multiple products and multiple ways to price each product. &nbsp;An example of that might be 5 t-shirt designs, where shirts are priced based on size and quantity ordered.</p>

    <p>Drupal 6 allows you to either display the comment form below saved comments or on a separate page.  There's surprisingly no way to configure the form to appear above the comments.  It's hard-coded at the bottom of comment_render to either append the form, or not at all.</p>
<p>There's a micro-module aptly titled 'Comment form above comments' which does the job but does so using string replaces on resulting html so it's not the ideal or elegant solution.</p>
<p>It turns out to be simple to get the same effect in code.</p>
<p>First, we need to "configure" the form to appear on a separate page, but only because we're going to manually show it.  You can ensure this configuration with the line:<br />
<div class="geshifilter"><pre class="javascript geshifilter-javascript" style="font-family:monospace;">variable_set<span style="color: #009900;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #3366CC;">'comment_form_location_'</span>.$node<span style="color: #339933;">-&gt;</span>type<span style="color: #339933;">,</span> COMMENT_FORM_SEPARATE_PAGE<span style="color: #009900;">&#41;</span><span style="color: #339933;">;</span></pre></div></p>
<p>You could even variable_get and re-variable_set after printing the form if you really wanted to.</p>
<p>Next, output the following where you want to display comments, whether in a PHP code block or node template:<br />
<div class="geshifilter"><pre class="javascript geshifilter-javascript" style="font-family:monospace;">$edit <span style="color: #339933;">=</span> array<span style="color: #009900;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #3366CC;">'nid'</span> <span style="color: #339933;">=&gt;</span> $node<span style="color: #339933;">-&gt;</span>nid<span style="color: #009900;">&#41;</span><span style="color: #339933;">;</span>
print comment_form_box<span style="color: #009900;">&#40;</span>$edit<span style="color: #009900;">&#41;</span> . <span style="color: #660066;">comment_render</span><span style="color: #009900;">&#40;</span>$node<span style="color: #009900;">&#41;</span><span style="color: #339933;">;</span></pre></div></p>
<p>Another recent discovery was that the comment form is hard-coded to redirect to /node after submitting.  This hack, as a module, will get you back to the page you submitted from:<br />
<div class="geshifilter"><pre class="javascript geshifilter-javascript" style="font-family:monospace;"><span style="color: #000066; font-weight: bold;">function</span> noredirect_comment_form_submit<span style="color: #009900;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #339933;">&amp;</span>$form<span style="color: #339933;">,</span> <span style="color: #339933;">&amp;</span>$form_state<span style="color: #009900;">&#41;</span> <span style="color: #009900;">&#123;</span>

      <h2>Where is Saigon?</h2>
  
    <div class="content">
      <p>It's not wrong to wonder where in the world Saigon is. </p>
<p>Saigon is the name of the city now officially known as Ho Chi Minh City. But most people who call Saigon home call their home Saigon and it's mostly tourists who I hear refer to it as Ho Chi Minh City (or Ho Chi Minh Ville for the French).</p>
<p>After the Vietnam/American War ended in 1975, many place names ceased to exist such as Saigon, South Vietnam, and plenty of street names. </p>
<p>Tu Do is now Dong Khoi, Thong Nhat is Le Duan. And Tan Son Nhut Airport is now <a href="../../content/ho-chi-minh-citys-tan-san-nhat-international-airport.html">Tan Son Nhat International Airport</a>. Rue Paul Blanchy has been Hai Ba Trung since the 1950s.</p>
<p>Those who haven't seen Vietnam for decades will be confused not just by the geographical changes but the incredible amount of development and modernization that has since taken place.</p>

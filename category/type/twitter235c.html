07/01 03:14 @caligarn Friend says it's pre-Reunification Saigonese style; should be celebrated. Then again rich culture lead to the fall of South VN.. #<br />

06/28 18:16 @vietdlam Check again, Vietnam isn't on that list of countries. US promotes tourism from Europe, rich Asian countries. #<br />
06/28 17:26 @vietdlam Also, the US isn't paying millions of $$ to get visitors from VN to come, only to make it difficult once they do #<br />
06/28 17:23 @vietdlam Perhaps it's unfair that VNese can't easily visit developed countries, but at least when they do they don't need to bribe the US #<br />

06/03 03:23 @jon7b I always :( a little when VNers use English names. Wish they'd choose cool names like Ice Thi  or names from Decepticons #<br />

05/27 06:16 @ericburdette @shakkabrutha Generally (USA), any dropped helmet is no longer considered safe. A cracked one's a goner for sure #<br />

05/26 06:06 @jjlechau @Uyenvu Hmm, how about phones (w/ tiny watch battery) that emit a loud siren/message when texted a secret code #<br />

      <h2>Where is Saigon?</h2>
  
    <div class="content">
      <p>It's not wrong to wonder where in the world Saigon is. </p>
<p>Saigon is the name of the city now officially known as Ho Chi Minh City. But most people who call Saigon home call their home Saigon and it's mostly tourists who I hear refer to it as Ho Chi Minh City (or Ho Chi Minh Ville for the French).</p>
<p>After the Vietnam/American War ended in 1975, many place names ceased to exist such as Saigon, South Vietnam, and plenty of street names. </p>
<p>Tu Do is now Dong Khoi, Thong Nhat is Le Duan. And Tan Son Nhut Airport is now <a href="../../content/ho-chi-minh-citys-tan-san-nhat-international-airport.html">Tan Son Nhat International Airport</a>. Rue Paul Blanchy has been Hai Ba Trung since the 1950s.</p>
<p>Those who haven't seen Vietnam for decades will be confused not just by the geographical changes but the incredible amount of development and modernization that has since taken place.</p>
